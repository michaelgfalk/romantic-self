                        <hi rend="small-caps">The</hi> letters and journals of <persName>Lord Byron</persName>,
                        with the interwoven notes of <persName key="ThMoore1852">Mr. Moore</persName>, should have
                        superseded the utility of writing any other account of that extraordinary man. The
                        compilation has, however, not proved satisfactory, and the consequence, almost of
                        necessity, is, that many other biographical portraits of the noble poet may yet be
                        expected; but will they materially alter the general effect of <persName>Mr.
                            Moore&#8217;s</persName> work? I think not; and have accordingly confined myself, as
                        much as practicable, consistent with the end in view, to an outline of his Lordship&#8217;s
                        intellectual features&#8212;a substratum only of the general mass of his character. </p>

                    <p xml:id="preface-2"> If <persName key="ThMoore1852">Mr. Moore</persName> has evinced too
                        eager an anxiety to set out the best qualities of his friend to the brightest advantage, it
                        ought to be recollected that no less was expected of him. The spirit of the times ran
                        strong against <persName>Lord Byron</persName>, as a man; and it was natural, that
                            <persName>Mr. Moore</persName> should attempt to stem the tide. I respect the
                        generosity with which he has executed his task. I think that he has made no striking
                            misre-<pb xml:id="JG.iv"/>presentation; I even discern but little exaggeration,
                        although he has amiably chosen to paint only the sunny side: the limning is correct; but
                        the likeness is too radiant and conciliatory. </p>

                    <p xml:id="preface-3"> There is one point with respect to the subsequent pages, on which I
                        think it unnecessary to offer any explanation&#8212;the separation of Lord and <persName
                            key="LyByron">Lady Byron</persName>. I have avoided, as much as I well could, every
                        thing like the expression of an opinion on the subject. <persName key="ThMoore1852">Mr.
                            Moore</persName> has done all in his power to excuse his Lordship; and <persName>Lady
                            Byron</persName> has protested against the correctness of his statement, without
                        however assigning any reason for her own conduct, calculated to satisfy the public, who
                        have been too indecorously, I conceive, made parties to the question. </p>

                    <p xml:id="preface-4"> But I should explain that in omitting to notice the rancour with which
                            <persName>Lord Byron</persName> was pursued by <persName key="RoSouth1843">Dr.
                            Southey</persName>, I have always considered his Lordship as the first aggressor. The
                        affair is therefore properly comprehended in the general observations respecting the
                        enemies whom the satire of <name type="title" key="LdByron.Bards">English Bards and Scotch
                            Reviewers</name> provoked. I may add further, in explanation, that I did not conceive
                        any particular examination was required of his Lordship&#8217;s minor poems, nor of his
                        part in the controversy concerning the poetical genius of <persName key="AlPope1744"
                            >Pope</persName>. </p>

                    <p xml:id="preface-5"> Considering how much the conduct of <persName>Lord Byron</persName> has
                        been in question, perhaps I ought to state, that I never stood on such a footing with his
                        Lordship as to <pb xml:id="JG.v"/> inspire me with any sentiment likely to bias my
                        judgment. I am indebted to him for no other favours than those which a well-bred person of
                        rank bestows in the interchange of civility on a man who is of none, and that I do not
                        undervalue the courtesy with which he ever treated me, will probably be apparent. I am
                        gratified with the recollection of having known a person so celebrated, and I believe
                        myself incapable of intentional injustice. I can only regret the impression he made upon
                        me, if it shall be thought I have spoken of him with prejudice. </p>

                    <p xml:id="preface-6"> It will be seen by a note, relative to a circumstance which took place
                        in <persName>Lord Byron&#8217;s</persName> conduct towards the <persName key="TeGuicc1873"
                            >Countess Guiccioli</persName>, that <persName key="JoHobho1869">Mr.
                            Hobhouse</persName> has enabled me to give two versions of an affair not regarded by
                        some of that lady&#8217;s relations as having been marked by generosity; but I could not
                        expunge from the text what I had stated, having no reason to doubt the authenticity of my
                        information. The reader is enabled to form his own opinion on the subject. </p>

                    <p xml:id="preface-7"> I cannot conclude without offering my best acknowledgements to the
                        learned and ingenious <persName key="NiNicol1848">Mr. Nicolas</persName>, for the curious
                        genealogical fact of a baton sinister being in the escutcheon of the Byrons of Newstead.
                            <persName>Lord Byron</persName>, in his pride of birth, does not appear to have been
                        aware of this stain. </p>

                <lb/>

                <p xml:id="intro-1">
                    <hi rend="small-caps">My</hi> present task is one of considerable difficulty; but I have long
                    had a notion that some time or another it would fall to my lot to perform it. I approach it,
                    therefore, without apprehension, entirely in consequence of having determined, to my own
                    satisfaction, the manner in which the biography of so singular and so richly endowed a
                    character as that of the late <persName key="LdByron">Lord Byron</persName> should be treated,
                    but still with no small degree of diffidence; for there is a wide difference between
                    determining a rule for oneself, and producing, according to that rule, a work which shall
                    please the public. </p>

                <p xml:id="intro-2"> It has happened, both with regard to the man and the poet, that from the first
                    time his name came before the public, there has been a vehement and continual controversy
                    concerning him; and the chief difficulties of the task arise out of the heat with which the
                    adverse parties have maintained their respective opinions. The circumstances in which he was
                    placed, until his accession to the title and estates of his <pb xml:id="JG.2"/> ancestors, were
                    not such as to prepare a boy that would be father to a prudent or judicious man. Nor, according
                    to the history of his family, was his blood without a taint of sullenness, which disqualified
                    him from conciliating the good opinion of those whom his innate superiority must have often
                    prompted him to desire for friends. He was branded, moreover, with a personal deformity; and
                    the grudge against Nature for inflicting this defect not only deeply disturbed his happiness,
                    but so generally affected his feelings as to embitter them with a vindictive sentiment, so
                    strong as, at times, to exhibit the disagreeable energy of misanthropy. This was not all. He
                    enjoyed high rank, and was conscious of possessing great talents; but his fortune was
                    inadequate to his desires, and his talents were not of an order to redeem the deficiencies of
                    fortune. It likewise so happened that while indulged by his only friend, his mother, to an
                    excess that impaired the manliness of his character, her conduct was such as in no degree to
                    merit the affection which her wayward fondness inspired. </p>

                <p xml:id="intro-3"> It is impossible to reflect on the boyhood of <persName key="LdByron"
                        >Byron</persName> without regret. There is not one point in it all which could, otherwise
                    than with pain, have affected a young mind of sensibility. His works bear testimony, that while
                    his memory retained the impressions of early youth, fresh and unfaded, there was a gloom and
                    shadow upon them, which proved how little they had been really joyous. </p>

                <p xml:id="intro-4"> The riper years of one so truly the nursling of pride, poverty, and pain,
                    could only be inconsistent, wild, and impassioned, even had his temperament been moderate and
                    well disciplined. But when it is considered that in addition to all the awful influences of
                    these fatalities, for they can receive no lighter name, he possessed an imagination of
                    unbounded capacity&#8212;was inflamed with those indescribable feelings which constitute, in
                    the opinion of many, the <pb xml:id="JG.3"/> very elements of genius&#8212;fearfully quick in
                    the discernment of the darker qualities of character&#8212;and surrounded by
                    temptation&#8212;his career ceases to surprise. It would have been more wonderful had he proved
                    an amiable and well-conducted man, than the questionable and extraordinary being who has alike
                    provoked the malice and interested the admiration of the world. </p>

                <p xml:id="intro-5"> Posterity, while acknowledging the eminence of his endowments, and lamenting
                    the habits which his unhappy circumstances induced, will regard it as a curious phenomenon in
                    the fortunes of the individual, that the progress of his fame as a poet should have been so
                    similar to his history as a man. </p>

                <p xml:id="intro-6"> His first attempts, though displaying both originality and power, were
                    received with a contemptuous disdain, as cold and repulsive as the penury and neglect which
                    blighted the budding of his youth. The unjust ridicule in the review of his first poems,
                    excited in his spirit a discontent as inveterate as the feeling which sprung from his
                    deformity: it affected, more or less, all his conceptions to such a degree that he may be said
                    to have hated the age which had joined in the derision, as he cherished an antipathy against
                    those persons who looked curiously at his foot. <name type="title" key="LdByron.Harold">Childe
                        Harold</name>, the most triumphant of his works, was produced when the world was kindliest
                    disposed to set a just value on his talents; and his latter productions, in which the faults of
                    his taste appear the broadest, were written when his errors as a man were harshest in the
                    public voice. </p>

                <p xml:id="intro-7"> These allusions to the incidents of a life full of contrarieties, and to a
                    character so strange as to be almost mysterious, sufficiently show the difficulties of the task
                    I have undertaken. But the course I intend to pursue will relieve me from the necessity of
                    entering, in any particular manner, upon those debatable points of his personal conduct which
                    have <pb xml:id="JG.4"/> been so much discussed. I shall consider him, if I can, as his
                    character will be estimated when contemporary surmises are forgotten, and when the monument he
                    has raised to himself is contemplated for its beauty and magnificence, without suggesting
                    recollections of the eccentricities of the builder. </p>

                    eminent families of the kingdom, under the names of <persName>Buron</persName> and
                        <persName>Biron</persName>. It was not until the reign of <persName key="Henry2">Henry

                <p xml:id="chap1-2"> Although for upwards of seven hundred years distinguished for the extent of

                    <persName>Erneis</persName> and <persName key="RaBuron1080">Ralph</persName> were the
                    companions of the Conqueror; but antiquaries and genealogists have not determined in what
                    relation they stood to each other. <persName>Erneis</persName>, who appears to have been the
                    more considerable personage of the two, held numerous manors in the counties of York and
                    Lincoln. In the Domesday Book, <persName>Ralph</persName>, the direct ancestor of the poet,
                    ranks high among the tenants of the Crown, in Notts and Derbyshire; in the latter county he
                    resided at Horestan Castle, from which he took his title. One of the lords of Horestan was a
                    hostage for the payment of the ransom of <persName key="Richard1">Richard C&#339;ur de

                    possessions of his descendants were augmented by the addition of the Manor of Rochdale, in
                    Lancashire. On what account <pb xml:id="JG.6"/> this new grant was given has not been

                    afterwards appointed Constable of Nottingham Castle and Warden of Sherwood Forest. At his

                    Newstead, in the county of Nottingham, together with the manor and rectory of Papelwick, were
                    granted. The abbey from that period became the family seat, and continued so until it was sold

                    London. In this situation he became obnoxious to the refractory spirits in the Parliament, and
                    was in consequence ordered by the Commons to answer at the bar of their House certain charges
                    which the sectaries alleged against him. But he refused to leave his post without the
                    king&#8217;s command; and, upon this, the Commons applied to the Lords to join them in a
                    petition to the king to remove him. The Peers rejected the proposition. </p>

                    during the civil war, were eminently distinguished. At the battle of Newbury, seven of the
                    brothers were in the field, and all actively engaged. </p>

                    honours on the death of his father in 1736. He entered the naval service, and became a
                    lieutenant under <persName key="JoBalch1744">Admiral Balchen</persName>. In the year 1763 he
                    was made Master of the Staghounds; and in 1765, he was sent to the Tower, and tried before the
                    House of Peers, for killing his relation and neighbour, <persName key="WiChawo1765">Mr.

                <p xml:id="chap1-10"> This <persName key="LdByron5">Lord William</persName> was naturally
                    boisterous and vindictive. It appeared in evidence that he insisted on fighting with <persName

                    accordingly fought without seconds by the dim light of a single candle; and, although
                        <persName>Mr. Chaworth</persName> was the more skilful swordsman of the two, he received a
                    mortal wound; but he lived long enough to disclose some particulars of the rencounter, which
                    induced the coroner&#8217;s jury to return a verdict of wilful murder, and <persName>Lord
                        Byron</persName> was tried for the crime. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap1-11"> The trial took place in Westminster Hall, and the public curiosity was so
                    great that the Peers&#8217; tickets of admission were publicly sold for six guineas each. It
                    lasted two days, and at the conclusion he was unanimously pronounced guilty of manslaughter. On
                    being brought up for judgment he pleaded his privilege and was discharged. It was to this lord
                    that the Poet succeeded, for he died without leaving issue. </p>

                    are too well known to require any notice here. He married the <persName key="SoByron1758"

                        <pb xml:id="JG.9"/> and profligate that his father, the admiral, though a good-natured man,
                    discarded him long before his death. In 1778 he acquired extraordinary éclat by the seduction
                    of the <persName key="LyDarcy">Marchioness of Carmarthen</persName>, under circumstances which
                    have few parallels in the licentiousness of fashionable life. The meanness with which he
                    obliged his wretched victim to supply him with money would have been disgraceful to the basest
                    adulteries of the cellar or garret. A divorce ensued, the guilty parties married; but, within
                    two years after, such was the brutal and vicious conduct of <persName>Captain Byron</persName>,
                    that the ill-fated lady died literally of a broken heart, after having given birth to two
                    daughters, one of whom still survives. </p>

                    for they occasionally visited and drank tea with each other. The Captain also paid some
                    attention to the boy, and had him, on one occasion, to stay with him for a night, when he
                    proved so troublesome that he was sent home next day. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap1-20">
                    <persName key="LdByron">Byron</persName> himself has said, that he passed his boyhood at
                    Marlodge, near Aberdeen; but the statement is not correct; he visited, with his mother,
                    occasionally among their friends, and among other places passed some time at Fetteresso, the
                    seat of his godfather, <persName key="RoDuff1834">Colonel Duff</persName>. In 1796, after an
                    attack of the scarlet fever, he passed some time at Ballater, a summer resort for health and
                    gaiety, about forty miles up the Dee from Aberdeen. Although the circumstances of <persName
                        key="CaByron1811">Mrs. Byron</persName> were at this period exceedingly straitened, she
                    received a visit from her husband, the object of which was to extort more money; and he was so
                    far successful, that she contrived to borrow a sum, which enabled him to proceed to
                    Valenciennes, where in the following year he died, greatly to her relief and the gratification
                    of all who were connected with him. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap1-21"> By her advances to <persName key="JoByron1791">Captain Byron</persName>, and
                    the expenses she incurred in furnishing the flat of the house she <pb xml:id="JG.12"/> occupied
                    after his death, <persName key="CaByron1811">Mrs Byron</persName> fell into debt to the amount
                    of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the interest on which reduced her income to 135<hi
                        rend="italic">l</hi>.; but, much to her credit, she contrived to live without increasing
                    her embarrassments until the death of her grandmother, when she received 1122<hi rend="italic"
                        >l</hi>., a sum which had been set apart for the old gentlewoman&#8217;s jointure, and
                    which enabled her to discharge her pecuniary obligations. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap1-22"> Notwithstanding the manner in which this unfortunate lady was treated by her
                    husband, she always entertained for him a strong affection; insomuch that, when the
                    intelligence of his death arrived, her grief was loud and vehement. She was indeed a woman of
                    quick feelings and strong passions; and probably it was by the strength and sincerity of her
                    sensibility that she retained so long the affection of her son, towards whom it cannot be
                    doubted that her love was unaffected. In the midst of the neglect and penury to which she was
                    herself subjected, she bestowed upon him all the care, the love and watchfulness of the
                    tenderest mother. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap1-23"> In his fifth year, on the 19th of November, 1792, she sent him to a
                    day-school, where she paid about five shillings a quarter, the common rate of the respectable
                    day-schools at that time in Scotland. It was kept by a <persName key="JoBower1800">Mr.
                        Bowers</persName>, whom <persName key="LdByron">Byron</persName> has described as a dapper,
                    spruce person, with whom he made no progress. How long he remained with <persName>Mr.
                        Bowers</persName> is not mentioned, but by the day-book of the school it was at least
                    twelve months; for on the 19th of November of the following year there is an entry of a guinea
                    having been paid for him. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap1-24"> From this school he was removed and placed with a <persName key="JaRoss1824"
                        >Mr. Ross</persName>, one of the ministers of the city churches, and to whom he formed some
                    attachment, as he speaks of him with kindness, and describes him as a devout, clever little man
                    of mild manners, good-natured, and pains-taking. His third instructor was a serious, saturnine,
                    kind young man, named <persName key="JoPater1797">Paterson</persName>, the son of <pb
                        xml:id="JG.13"/> a shoemaker, but a good scholar and a rigid Presbyterian. It is somewhat
                    curious in the record which <persName key="LdByron">Byron</persName> has made of his early
                    years to observe the constant endeavour with which he, the descendant of such a limitless
                    pedigree and great ancestors, attempts to magnify the condition of his mother&#8217;s
                    circumstances. </p>

                    <persName key="JoPater1797">Paterson</persName> attended him until he went to the
                    grammar-school, where his character first began to be developed; and his schoolfellows, many of
                    whom are alive, still recollect him as a lively, warm-hearted, and high-spirited boy,
                    passionate and resentful, but withal affectionate and companionable; this, however, is an
                    opinion given of him after he had become celebrated; for a very different impression has
                    unquestionably remained among some who carry their recollections back to his childhood. By them
                    he has been described as a malignant imp: was often spoken of for his pranks by the worthy
                    housewives of the neighbourhood, as &#8220;<q><persName>Mrs. Byron&#8217;s</persName> crockit
                        deevil,</q>&#8221; and generally disliked for the deep vindictive anger he retained against

                    <hi rend="small-caps">Before</hi> I proceed to the regular narrative of the character and
                    adventures of <persName key="LdByron">Lord Byron</persName>, it seems necessary to consider the
                    probable effects of his residence, during his boyhood, in Scotland. It is generally agreed,
                    that while a schoolboy in Aberdeen, he evinced a lively spirit, and sharpness enough to have
                    equalled any of his schoolfellows, had he given sufficient application. In the few
                    reminiscences preserved of his childhood, it is remarkable that he appears in this period,
                    commonly of innocence and playfulness, rarely to have evinced any symptom of generous feeling.
                    Silent rages, moody sullenness, and revenge are the general characteristics of his conduct as a
                    boy. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap2-2"> He was, undoubtedly, delicately susceptible of impressions from the beauties
                    of nature, for he retained recollections of the scenes which interested his childish wonder,
                    fresh and glowing, to his latest days; nor have there been wanting plausible theories to
                    ascribe the formation of his poetical character to the contemplation of those romantic scenes.
                    But, whoever has attended to the influential causes of character will reject such theories as
                    shallow, and betraying great ignorance of human nature. Genius of every kind belongs to some
                    innate temperament; it does not necessarily imply a particular bent, because that may possibly
                    be the effect of circumstances; but, <pb xml:id="JG.15"/> without question, the peculiar
                    quality is inborn, and particular to the individual. All hear and see much alike; but there is
                    an undefinable though wide difference between the ear of the musician, or the eye of the
                    painter, compared with the hearing and seeing organs of ordinary men; and it is in something
                    like that difference in which genius consists. Genius is, however, an ingredient of mind more
                    easily described by its effects than by its qualities. It is as the fragrance, independent of
                    the freshness and complexion of the rose; as the light on the cloud; as the bloom on the cheek
                    of beauty, of which the possessor is unconscious until the charm has been seen by its influence
                    on others; it is the internal golden flame of the opal; a something which may be abstracted
                    from the thing in which it appears, without changing the quality of its substance, its form, or
                    its affinities. I am not, therefore, disposed to consider the idle and reckless childhood of
                        <persName key="LdByron">Byron</persName> as unfavourable to the development of his genius;
                    but, on the contrary, inclined to think, that the indulgence of his mother, leaving him so much
                    to the accidents of undisciplined impression, was calculated to cherish associations which
                    rendered them, in the maturity of his powers, ingredients of spell that ruled his memory. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap2-3"> It is singular, and I am not aware it has been before noticed, that with all
                    his tender and impassioned apostrophes to beauty and love, <persName key="LdByron"
                        >Byron</persName> has in no instance, not even in the freest passages of <name type="title"
                        key="LdByron.Juan">Don Juan</name>, associated either the one or the other with sensual
                    images. The extravagance of <persName key="WiShake1616"
                        >Shakespeare&#8217;s</persName>&#160;<persName type="fiction">Juliet</persName>, when she
                    speaks of <persName type="fiction">Romeo</persName> being cut after his death into stars, that
                    all the world may be in love with night, is flame and ecstasy compared to the icy metaphysical
                    glitter of <persName>Byron&#8217;s</persName> amorous allusions. The verses beginning with <q>
                        <lg xml:id="JG.16a">
                            <l rend="indent40"> She walks in beauty like the light </l>
                            <l rend="indent40"> Of eastern climes and starry skies, </l>
                        </lg>
                    </q>
                    <pb xml:id="JG.16"/> is a perfect example of what I have conceived of his bodiless admiration
                    of beauty, and objectless enthusiasm of love. The sentiment itself is unquestionably in the
                    highest mood of the intellectual sense of beauty; the simile is, however, any thing but such an
                    image as the beauty of woman would suggest. It is only the remembrance of some impression or
                    imagination of the loveliness of a twilight applied to an object that awakened the same
                    abstract general idea of beauty. The fancy which could conceive in its passion the charms of a
                    female to be like the glow of the evening, or the general effect of the midnight stars, must
                    have been enamoured of some beautiful abstraction, rather than aught of flesh and blood. Poets
                    and lovers have compared the complexion of their mistresses to the hues of the morning or of
                    the evening, and their eyes to the dewdrops and the stars; but it has no place in the feelings
                    of man to think of female charms in the sense of admiration which the beauties of the morning
                    or the evening awaken. It is to make the simile the principal. Perhaps, however, it may be as
                    well to defer the criticism to which this peculiar characteristic of
                        <persName>Byron&#8217;s</persName> amatory effusions gives rise, until we shall come to
                    estimate his general powers as a poet. There is upon the subject of love, no doubt, much
                    beautiful composition throughout his works; but not one line in all the thousands which shows a
                    sexual feeling of female attraction&#8212;all is vague and passionless, save in the delicious
                    rhythm of the verse. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap2-4"> But these remarks, though premature as criticisms, are not uncalled for here,
                    even while we are speaking of a child not more than ten years old. Before <persName
                        key="LdByron">Byron</persName> had attained that age, he describes himself as having felt
                    the passion. <persName key="DaAligh">Dante</persName> is said as early as nine years old to
                    have fallen in love with <persName type="fiction">Beatrice</persName>; <persName
                        key="ViAlfie1803">Alfieri</persName>, who was himself precocious in the passion, considered
                    such early sensibility to be an unerring sign of a soul formed for the fine arts; and <persName
                        key="AnCanov1822">Canova</persName>
                    <pb xml:id="JG.17"/> used to say that he was in love when but five years old. But these
                    instances, however, prove nothing. Calf-love, as it is called in the country, is common; and in
                    Italy it may arise earlier than in the bleak and barren regions of Lochynagar. This movement of
                    juvenile sentiment is not, however, love&#8212;that strong masculine avidity, which, in its
                    highest excitement, is unrestrained, by the laws alike of God and man. In truth, the feeling of
                    this kind of love is the very reverse of the irrepressible passion it is a mean shrinking,
                    stealthy awe, and in no one of its symptoms, at least in none of those which
                        <persName>Byron</persName> describes, has it the slightest resemblance to that bold energy
                    which has prompted men to undertake the most improbable adventures. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap2-5"> He was not quite eight years old when, according to his own account, he formed
                    an impassioned attachment to <persName key="MaDuff1858">Mary Duff</persName>; and he gives the
                    following account of his recollection of her, nineteen years afterwards. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap2-6">
                    <q>&#8220;I have been thinking lately a good deal of <persName key="MaDuff1858">Mary
                            Duff</persName>. How very odd that I should have been so devotedly fond of that girl,
                        at an age when I could neither feel passion, nor know the meaning of the word and the
                        effect! My <persName key="CaByron1811">mother</persName> used always to rally me about this
                        childish amour, and at last, many years after, when I was sixteen, she told me one day,
                            <q>&#8216;O <persName>Byron</persName>, I have had a letter from Edinburgh, and your
                            old sweetheart, <persName>Mary Duff</persName>, is married to <persName>Mr.
                                C****</persName>.&#8217;</q> And what was my answer? I really cannot explain or
                        account for my feelings at that moment, but they nearly threw me into convulsions, and
                        alarmed my mother so much, that after I grew better she generally avoided the
                        subject&#8212;to <hi rend="italic">me</hi>&#8212;and contented herself with telling it to
                        all her acquaintance.&#8221;</q> But was this agitation the effect of natural feeling, or
                    of something in the manner in which his mother may have <pb xml:id="JG.18"/> told the news? He
                    proceeds to inquire. <q>&#8220;Now what could this be? I had never seen her since her
                        mother&#8217;s <hi rend="italic">faux pas</hi> at Aberdeen had been the cause of her
                        removal to her grandmother&#8217;s at Banff. We were both the merest children. I had, and
                        have been, attached fifty times since that period; yet I recollect all we said to each
                        other, all our caresses, her features, my restlessness, sleeplessness, my tormenting my
                        mother&#8217;s maid to write for me to her, which she at last did to quiet me. Poor
                            <persName>Nancy</persName> thought I was wild, and, as I could not write for myself,
                        became my secretary. I remember too our walks, and the happiness of sitting by
                            <persName>Mary</persName>, in the children&#8217;s apartment, at their house, not far
                        from the Plainstones, at Aberdeen, while her lesser sister, <persName>Helen</persName>,
                        played with the doll, and we sat gravely making love in our own way.</q>
                </p>

                <p xml:id="chap2-7">
                    <q> &#8220;How the deuce did all this occur so early? Where could it originate? I certainly had
                        no sexual ideas for years afterward, and yet my misery, my love for that girl, were so
                        violent, that I sometimes doubt if I have ever been really attached since. Be that as it
                        may, hearing of her marriage, several years afterward, was as a thunderstroke. It nearly
                        choked me, to the horror of my mother, and the astonishment and almost incredulity of
                        everybody; and it is a phenomenon in my existence, for I was not eight years old, which has
                        puzzled and will puzzle me to the latest hour of it. And, lately, I know not why, the <hi

                        recurred as forcibly as ever: I wonder if she can have the least remembrance of it or me,
                        or remember pitying her sister <persName>Helen</persName>, for not having an admirer too.
                        How very pretty is the perfect image of her in my memory. Her dark brown hair and hazel
                        eyes, her very dress&#8212;I should be quite grieved to see her now. The reality, however
                        beautiful, would destroy, or at least confuse, the features of the lovely <pb
                            xml:id="JG.19"/> Peri, which then existed in her, and still lives in my imagination, at
                        the distance of more than sixteen years.&#8221; </q>
                </p>

                <p xml:id="chap2-8"> Such precocious and sympathetic affections are, as I have already mentioned,
                    common among children, and is something very different from the love of riper years; but the
                    extract is curious, and shows how truly little and vague <persName key="LdByron"
                        >Byron&#8217;s</persName> experience of the passion must have been. In his recollection of
                    the girl, be it observed, there is no circumstance noticed which shows, however strong the
                    mutual sympathy, the slightest influence of particular attraction. He recollects the colour of
                    her hair, the hue of her eyes, her very dress, and he remembers her as a Peri, a spirit; nor
                    does it appear that his sleepless restlessness, in which the thought of her was ever uppermost,
                    was produced by jealousy, or doubt, or fear, or any other concomitant of the passion. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap2-9"> There is another most important circumstance in what may be called the
                    Aberdonian epoch of <persName key="LdByron">Lord Byron&#8217;s life.</persName>
                </p>

                <p xml:id="chap2-10"> That <persName key="LdByron">Byron</persName>, in his boyhood, was possessed
                    of lively sensibilities, is sufficiently clear; that he enjoyed the advantage of indulging his
                    humour and temper without restraint, is not disputable; and that his natural temperament made
                    him sensible, in no ordinary degree, to the beauties of nature, is also abundantly manifest in
                    all his productions; but it is surprising that this admiration of the beauties of nature is but
                    an ingredient in <persName>Byron&#8217;s</persName> poetry, and not its most remarkable
                    characteristic. Deep feelings of dissatisfaction and disappointment are far more obvious; they
                    constitute, indeed, the very spirit of his works, and a spirit of such qualities is the least
                    of all likely to have arisen from the contemplation of magnificent nature, or to have been
                    inspired by studying her storms or serenity; for dissatisfaction and disappointment are the
                    offspring of moral experience, and have no natural as-<pb xml:id="JG.20"/>sociation with the
                    forms of external things. The habit of associating morose sentiments with any particular kind
                    of scenery only shows that the sources of the sullenness arose in similar visible
                    circumstances. It is from these premises I would infer, that the seeds of
                        <persName>Byron&#8217;s</persName> misanthropic tendencies were implanted during the
                    &#8220;silent rages&#8221; of his childhood, and that the effect of mountain scenery, which
                    continued so strong upon him after he left Scotland, producing the sentiments with which he has
                    imbued his heroes in the wild circumstances in which he places them, was mere reminiscence and
                    association. For although the sullen tone of his mind was not fully brought out until he wrote
                        <name type="title" key="LdByron.Harold">Childe Harold</name>, it is yet evident from his
                        <name type="title" key="LdByron.Hours">Hours of Idleness</name> that he was tuned to that
                    key before he went abroad. The dark colouring of his mind was plainly imbibed in a mountainous
                    region, from sombre heaths, and in the midst of rudeness and grandeur. He had no taste for more
                    cheerful images, and there are neither rural objects nor villagery in the scenes he describes,
                    but only loneness and the solemnity of mountains. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap2-11"> To those who are acquainted with the Scottish character, it is unnecessary to
                    suggest how very probable it is that <persName key="CaByron1811">Mrs. Byron</persName> and her
                    associates were addicted to the oral legends of the district and of her ancestors, and that the
                    early fancy of the poet was nourished with the shadowy descriptions in the tales o&#8217; the
                    olden time;&#8212;at last this is manifest, that although <persName key="LdByron"
                        >Byron</persName> shows little of the melancholy and mourning of <persName type="fiction"
                        >Ossian</persName>, he was yet evidently influenced by some strong bias and congeniality of
                    taste to brood and cogitate on topics of the same character as those of that bard. Moreover,
                    besides the probability of his imagination having been early tinged with the sullen hue of the
                    local traditions, it is remarkable, that the longest of his juvenile poems is an imitation of
                    the manner of the <persName key="JaMacph1796">Homer of Morven</persName>. </p>

                <pb xml:id="JG.21"/>

                <p xml:id="chap2-12"> In addition to a natural temperament, kept in a state of continual
                    excitement, by unhappy domestic incidents, and the lurid legends of the past, there were other
                    causes in operation around the young poet that could not but greatly affect the formation of
                    his character. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap2-13"> Descended of a distinguished family, counting among its ancestors the fated
                    line of the Scottish kings, and reduced almost to extreme poverty, it is highly probable, both
                    from the violence of her temper, and the pride of blood, that <persName key="CaByron1811">Mrs.
                        Byron</persName> would complain of the almost mendicant condition to which she was reduced,
                    especially so long as there was reason to fear that her son was not likely to succeed to the
                    family estates and dignity. Of his father&#8217;s lineage few traditions were perhaps
                    preserved, compared with those of his mother&#8217;s family; but still enough was known to
                    impress the imagination. <persName key="ThMoore1852">Mr. Moore</persName>, struck with this
                    circumstance, has remarked, that <q>&#8220;in reviewing the ancestors, both near and remote, of
                            <persName key="LdByron">Lord Byron</persName>, it cannot fail to be remarked how
                        strikingly he combined in his own nature some of the best, and perhaps worst qualities that
                        lie scattered through the various characters of his predecessors.&#8221;</q> But still it
                    is to his mother&#8217;s traditions of her ancestors that I would ascribe the conception of the
                    dark and guilty beings which he delighted to describe. And though it may be contended that
                    there was little in her conduct to exalt poetical sentiment, still there was a great deal in
                    her condition calculated to affect and impel an impassioned disposition. I can imagine few
                    situations more likely to produce lasting recollections of interest and affection, than that in
                    which <persName>Mrs. Byron</persName>, with her only child, was placed in Aberdeen. Whatever
                    might have been the violence of her temper, or the improprieties of her afterlife, the fond and
                    mournful caresses with which she used to hang over her lame and helpless orphan, must have
                    greatly contributed to the <pb xml:id="JG.22"/> formation of that morbid sensibility which
                    became the chief characteristic of his life. At the same time, if it did contribute to fill his
                    days with anguish and anxieties, it also undoubtedly assisted the development of his powers;
                    and I am therefore disposed to conclude, that although, with respect to the character of the
                    man, the time he spent in Aberdeen can only be contemplated with pity, mingled with sorrow,
                    still it must have been richly fraught with incidents of inconceivable value to the genius of
                    the poet. </p>

                    detested by his tenantry, at war with his neighbours, and deserted by all his family. He not
                    only suffered the abbey to fall into decay, but, as far as lay in his power, alienated the land
                    which should have kept it in repair, and denuded the estate of the timber. <persName

                        crawl over him, and, when they were too familiar, he whipped them with a wisp of straw: at
                        his death, it is said, they left the house in a body.&#8221;</q>
                </p>

                <p xml:id="chap3-2"> However this may have been, it is certain that <persName key="LdByron"
                        >Byron</persName> came to an embarrassed inheritance, both as respected his property and
                    the character of his race; and, perhaps, though his genius suffered nothing by the
                    circumstance, it is to be regretted that he was still left under the charge of his mother; a
                    woman without judgment or self-command, alternately spoiling her child by indulgence,
                    irritating him by her self-willed obstinacy, and, what was still worse, amusing him <pb
                        xml:id="JG.24"/> by her violence, and disgusting him by fits of inebriety. Sympathy for her
                    misfortunes would be no sufficient apology for concealing her defects; they undoubtedly had a
                    material influence on her son, and her appearance was often the subject of his childish
                    ridicule. She was a short and corpulent person. She rolled in her gait, and would, in her rage,
                    sometimes endeavour to catch him for the purpose of inflicting punishment, while he would run
                    round the room, mocking her menaces and mimicking her motions. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap3-3"> The greatest weakness in <persName key="LdByron">Lord Byron&#8217;s</persName>
                    character was a morbid sensibility to his lameness. He felt it with as much vexation as if it
                    had been inflicted ignominy. One of the most striking passages in some memoranda which he has
                    left of his early days, is where, in speaking of his own sensitiveness on the subject of his
                    deformed foot, he described the feeling of horror and humiliation that came over him when his
                    mother, in one of her fits of passion, called him a <q>&#8220;lame brat.&#8221;</q>

                    the innocent fault in his foot was unmanly and excessive; for it was not greatly conspicuous,
                    and he had a mode of walking across a room by which it was scarcely at all perceptible. I was
                    several days on board the same ship with him before I happened to discover the defect; it was
                    indeed so well concealed, that I was in doubt whether his lameness was the effect of a
                    temporary accident, or a malformation, until I asked <persName key="JoHobho1869">Mr.

                    and that he might not lose ground in his education, he was attended by a respectable

                    regard in this instance peculiar; for it may be said to have been a distinguishing trait in his
                    character, to recollect with affection all who had been about him in his youth. The quack,
                    however, was an exception; who (from having caused him to suffer much pain, and whose
                    pretensions, even young as he then was, he detected) he delighted to expose. On one occasion,
                    he scribbled down on a sheet of paper, the letters of the alphabet at random, but in the form
                    of words and sentences, and placing them before <persName>Lavender</persName>, asked him
                    gravely, what language it was. &#8220;Italian,&#8221; was the reply, to the infinite amusement
                    of the little satirist, who burst into a triumphant laugh at the success of his stratagem. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap3-6"> It is said that about this time the first symptom of his predilection for

                    deserved. This venerable personage entertained a singular notion respecting the soul, which she
                    believed took its flight at death to the moon. One day, after a repetition of her original
                    contumely, he appeared before his nurse in a violent rage, and complained vehemently of the old
                    lady, declaring that he could not bear the sight of her, and then he broke out into the

                    the first twitter of his muse, he has said himself, <q>&#8220;My first dash into poetry was as
                        early as 1800. It was the ebullition of a passion for my first cousin, <persName
                            key="MaParke1802">Margaret Parker</persName>. I was then about twelve, she rather
                        older, perhaps a year.&#8221;</q> And it is curious to remark, that in his description of
                    this beautiful girl there is the same lack of animal admiration which we have noticed in all
                    his loves; he says of her:&#8212; </p>

                <p xml:id="chap3-13">
                    <q>&#8220;I do not recollect scarcely anything equal to the transparent beauty of my cousin, or
                        to the sweetness of her temper, during the short period of our intimacy: she looked as if
                        she had been made out of a rainbow, all beauty and peace.&#8221;</q> This is certainly
                    poetically expressed; but there was more true love in <persName type="fiction"
                        >Pygmalion&#8217;s</persName> passion for his statue, and in the Parisian maiden&#8217;s

                <p xml:id="chap3-14"> When he had been nearly two years under the tuition of <persName
                        key="WiGlenn1828">Dr. Glennie</persName>, he was removed to Harrow, chiefly in consequence
                    of his mother&#8217;s interference with his studies, and especially by withdrawing him often
                    from school. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap3-15"> During the time he was under the care of <persName key="WiGlenn1828">Dr.
                        Glennie</persName>, he was more amiable than at any other period of his life, a
                    circumstance which justifies the supposition, that had he been left more to the discipline of
                    that respectable person, he would have proved a better man; for however much his heart
                    afterwards became incrusted with the leprosy of selfishness, at this period his feelings were
                    warm and kind. Towards his <persName key="MaGray1800">nurse</persName> he evinced uncommon
                    affection, which he cherished as long as she lived. He presented her with his watch, the first
                    he possessed, and also a full-length miniature of himself, when he was only between seven and
                    eight years old, representing him with a profusion of curling locks, and in his hands a bow and
                    arrow. The <persName key="AgGray1800">sister</persName> of this woman had been his first nurse,
                    and after <pb xml:id="JG.28"/> he had left Scotland he wrote to her, in a spirit which
                    betokened a gentle and sincere heart, informing her with much joy of a circumstance highly
                    important to himself. It was to tell her that at last he had got his foot so far restored as to
                    be able to put on a common boot, an event which he was sure would give her great pleasure; to
                    himself it is difficult to imagine any incident which could have been more gratifying. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap3-16"> I dwell with satisfaction on these descriptions of his early dispositions;
                    for, although there are not wanting instances of similar warm-heartedness in his later years,
                    still he never formed any attachments so pure and amiable after he went to Harrow. The change
                    of life came over him, and when the vegetable period of boyhood was past, the animal passions
                    mastered all the softer affections of his character. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap3-17"> In the summer of 1801 he accompanied his mother to Cheltenham, and while he
                    resided there the views of the Malvern hills recalled to his memory his enjoyments amid the
                    wilder scenery of Aberdeenshire. The recollections were reimpressed on his heart and interwoven
                    with his strengthened feelings. But a boy gazing with emotion on the hills at sunset, because
                    they remind him of the mountains where he passed his childhood, is no proof that he is already
                    in heart and imagination a poet. To suppose so is to mistake the materials for the building. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap3-18"> The delight of <persName key="LdByron">Byron</persName> in contemplating the
                    Malvern hills, was not because they resembled the scenery of Lochynagar, but because they awoke
                    trains of thought and fancy, associated with recollections of that scenery. The poesy of the
                    feeling lay not in the beauty of the objects, but in the moral effect of the traditions, to
                    which these objects served as talismans of the memory. The scene at sunset reminded him of the
                    Highlands, but it was those reminiscences which similar scenes recalled, that constituted the
                    impulse, which gave life and elevation to his reflections. There <pb xml:id="JG.29"/> is not
                    more poesy in the sight of mountains than of plains; it is the local associations that throw
                    enchantment over all scenes, and resemblance that awakens them, binding them to new connexions:
                    nor does this admit of much controversy; for mountainous regions, however favourable to musical
                    feeling, are but little to poetical. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap3-19"> The Welsh have no eminent bard; the Swiss have no renown as poets; nor are
                    the mountainous regions of Greece, nor of the Apennines, celebrated for poetry. The Highlands
                    of Scotland, save the equivocal bastardy of <persName key="Ossia200">Ossian</persName>, have
                    produced no poet of any fame, and yet mountainous countries abound in local legends, which
                    would seem to be at variance with this opinion, were it not certain, though I cannot explain
                    the cause, that local poetry, like local language or local melody, is in proportion to the
                    interest it awakens among the local inhabitants, weak and ineffectual in its influence on the
                    sentiments of the general world. The Rans de Vaches, the most celebrated of all local airs, is
                    tame and commonplace,&#8212;unmelodious, to all ears but those of the Swiss &#8220;forlorn in a
                    foreign land.&#8221; </p>

                <p xml:id="chap3-20"> While in Cheltenham, <persName key="CaByron1811">Mrs. Byron</persName>
                    consulted a fortune-teller respecting the destinies of her son, and according to her feminine
                    notions, she was very cunning and guarded with the sybil, never suspecting that she might have
                    been previously known, and, unconscious to herself, an object of interest to the spae wife. She
                    endeavoured to pass herself off as a maiden lady, and regarded it as no small testimony of the
                    wisdom of the oracle, that she declared her to be not only a married woman, but the mother of a
                    son who was lame. After such a marvellous proof of second-sightedness, it may easily be
                    conceived with what awe and faith she listened to the prediction, that his life should be in
                    danger from poison before he was of age, and that he should be twice married; the second time
                    to a <pb xml:id="JG.30"/> foreign lady. Whether it was this same fortune-teller who foretold
                    that he would, in his twenty-seventh year, incur some great misfortune, is not certain; but,
                    considering his unhappy English marriage, and his subsequent Italian liaison with the <persName
                        key="TeGuicc1873">Countess Guiccioli</persName>, the marital prediction was not far from
                    receiving its accomplishment. The fact of his marriage taking place in his twenty-seventh year,
                    is at least a curious circumstance, and has been noticed by himself with a sentiment of
                    superstition. </p>

                        >Byron</persName> it was punishment; and for the first year and a half he hated the place.
                    In the end, however, he rose to be a leader in all the sports and mischiefs of his
                    schoolfellows; but it never could be said that he was a popular boy, however much he was
                    distinguished for spirit and bravery; for if he was not quarrelsome, he was sometimes
                    vindictive. Still it could not have been to any inveterate degree; for undoubtedly, in his
                    younger years, he was susceptible of warm impressions from gentle treatment, and his obstinacy
                    and arbitrary humour were perhaps more the effects of unrepressed habit than of natural bias;
                    they were the prickles which surrounded his genius in the bud. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap4-2"> At Harrow he acquired no distinction as a student; indeed, at no period was he
                    remarkable for steady application. Under <persName key="WiGlenn1828">Dr. Glennie</persName> he
                    had made but little progress; and it was chiefly in consequence of his backwardness that he was
                    removed from his academy. When placed with <persName key="JoDrury1834">Dr. Drury</persName>, it
                    was with an intimation that he had a cleverness about him, but that his education had been
                    neglected. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap4-3"> The early dislike which <persName key="LdByron">Byron</persName> felt towards
                    the <persName key="LdCarli5">Earl of Carlisle</persName> is abundantly well known, and he had
                    the magnanimity to acknowledge that it was in some respects unjust. But the antipathy was not
                    all on one side; nor will it be easy to parallel the conduct of the Earl with that of any
                    guardian. It is but justice, therefore, to <persName>Byron</persName>, to make the public aware
                    that the dislike began on the part of <persName>Lord Carlisle</persName>, and originated in
                    some distaste which he took to <persName key="CaByron1811">Mrs. Byron&#8217;s</persName>
                    manners, and at the trouble she sometimes gave him on account of her son. </p>

                    great singularity. She wrote beautiful verses and piquant epigrams; among <pb xml:id="JG.33"/>
                    others, there is a <name type="title" key="LyCarli4.Fairy">poetical effusion</name> of her pen

                    brother, shut herself up from the world. While she lived in this seclusion, she became an

                    about his business, for she did not care two skips of a louse for him. On coming to the hall,
                    finding paper and ink on the table, he wrote two lines in answer, and sent it up to her
                    Ladyship, to the effect that she always spoke of what was running in her head. </p>

                        at an age when we can neither feel nor understand the power of compositions, which it
                        requires an acquaintance with life, as well as Latin and Greek, to relish or to reason
                        upon. For the same reason, we never can be aware of the fulness of some of the finest
                        passages of <persName key="WiShake1616">Shakspeare</persName> (&#8216;To be, or not to
                        be,&#8217; for instance), from the habit of having them hammered into us at eight years
                        old, as an exercise not of mind but of memory; so that when we are old enough to enjoy
                        them, the taste is gone, and the appetite palled. In some parts of the continent, young
                        persons are taught from mere common authors, and do not read the best classics until their
                        maturity. I certainly do not speak on this point from any pique or aversion towards the
                        place of my education. I was not a slow or an idle boy; and I believe no one could be more
                        attached to Harrow than I have always been, and with reason: a part of the time passed
                        there was the happiest of my life; and my preceptor, the <persName key="JoDrury1834">Rev.
                            Dr. Joseph Drury</persName>, was the best and worthiest friend I ever possessed; whose
                        warnings I have remembered but too well, though too late, when I have erred; and whose
                        counsels I have but followed when I have done well and wisely. If ever this imperfect
                        record of my <pb xml:id="JG.35"/> feelings towards him should reach his eyes, let it remind
                        him of one who never thinks of him but with gratitude and veneration; of one who would more
                        gladly boast of having been his pupil if, by more closely following his injunctions, he
                        could reflect any honour upon his instructor.&#8221; </q>

                    <persName key="LdByron">Lord Byron</persName>, however, is not singular in his opinion of the
                    inutility of premature classical studies; and notwithstanding the able manner in which the late
                        <persName key="WiVince1815">Dean Vincent</persName> defended public education, we have some
                    notion that his reasoning upon this point will not be deemed conclusive. <persName
                        key="JoMilto1674">Milton</persName>, says <persName>Dr. Vincent</persName>, complained of
                    the years that were wasted in teaching the dead languages. <persName key="AbCowle1667"
                        >Cowley</persName> also complained that classical education taught words only and not
                    things; and <persName key="JoAddis1719">Addison</persName> deemed it an inexpiable error, that
                    boys with genius or without were all to be bred poets indiscriminately. As far, then, as
                    respects the education of a poet, we should think that the names of
                    <persName>Milton</persName>, <persName>Cowley</persName>, <persName>Addison</persName>, and
                        <persName>Byron</persName> would go well to settle the question; especially when it is
                    recollected how little <persName key="WiShake1616">Shakspeare</persName> was indebted to the
                    study of the classics, and that <persName key="RoBurns1796">Burns</persName> knew nothing of
                    them at all. I do not, however, adopt the opinion as correct; neither do I think that
                        <persName>Dean Vincent</persName> took a right view of the subject; for, as discipline, the
                    study of the classics may be highly useful, at the same time, the mere hammering of Greek and
                    Latin into English cannot be very conducive to the refinement of taste or the exaltation of
                    sentiment. Nor is there either common sense or correct logic in the following observations made
                    on the passage and note, quoted by the anonymous <persName key="FrHodgs1852">author</persName>

                <p xml:id="chap4-11">
                    <q> &#8220;This doctrine of antipathies, contracted by the impatience of youth against the
                        noblest authors of antiquity, from the circumstance of having been made the vehicle of
                        early instruction, is a most dangerous doctrine indeed; since it strikes at the root, not
                        only <pb xml:id="JG.36"/> of all pure taste, but of all praiseworthy industry. It would, if
                        acted upon (as <persName type="fiction">Harold</persName> by the mention of the Continental
                        practice of using inferior writers in the business of tuition would seem to recommend),
                        destroy the great source of the intellectual vigour of our countrymen.&#8221; </q>
                </p>

                <p xml:id="chap4-12"> This is, undoubtedly, assuming too much; for those who have objected to the
                    years &#8220;wasted&#8221; in teaching the dead languages, do not admit that the labour of
                    acquiring them either improves the taste or adds to the vigour of the understanding; and,
                    therefore, before the soundness of the opinion of <persName key="JoMilto1674"
                    >Milton</persName>, of <persName key="AbCowle1667">Cowley</persName>, of <persName

                    on those who are of <persName key="WiVince1815">Dean Vincent&#8217;s</persName> opinion, and
                    that of <name type="title" key="FrHodgs1852.Monitor">Childe Harold&#8217;s Monitor</name>, to
                    prove that the study of the learned languages is of so much primary importance as they claim
                    for it. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap4-13"> But it appears that <persName key="LdByron">Byron&#8217;s</persName> mind,
                    during the early period of his residence at Harrow, was occupied with another object than his
                    studies, and which may partly account for his inattention to them. He fell in love with
                        <persName key="MaMuste1832">Mary Chaworth</persName>. <q>&#8220;She was,&#8221; he is
                        represented to have said, &#8220;several years older than myself, but at my age boys like
                        something older than themselves, as they do younger later in life. Our estates adjoined,
                        but owing to the unhappy circumstances of the feud (the affair of the fatal duel), our
                        families, as is generally the case with neighbours, who happen to be near relations, were
                        never on terms of more than common civility, scarcely those. She was the beau ideal of all
                        that my youthful fancy could paint of the beautiful! and I have taken all my fables about
                        the celestial nature of women from the perfection my imagination created in her. I say
                        created, for I found her, like the rest of the sex, anything but angelic. I returned to
                        Harrow, after my trip to Cheltenham, more deeply enamoured than ever, and passed the next
                        holidays at Newstead. I now began to fancy <pb xml:id="JG.37"/> myself a man, and to make
                        love in earnest. Our meetings were stolen ones, and my letters passed through the medium of
                        a confidant. A gate leading from <persName>Mr. Chaworth&#8217;s</persName> grounds to those
                        of my mother, was the place of our interviews, but the ardour was all on my side; I was
                        serious, she was volatile. She liked me as a younger brother, and treated and laughed at me
                        as a boy; she, however, gave me her picture, and that was something to make verses upon.
                        Had I married <persName>Miss Chaworth</persName>, perhaps the whole tenor of my life would
                        have been different; she jilted me, however, but her marriage proved anything but a happy
                        one.&#8221;</q> It is to this attachment that we are indebted for the beautiful poem of
                        <name type="title" key="LdByron.Dream">The Dream</name>, and the stanzas beginning <q>
                        <lg xml:id="JG.37a">

                </p>

                <p xml:id="chap4-14"> Although this love affair a little interfered with his Greek and Latin, his
                    time was not passed without some attention to reading. Until he was eighteen years old, he had
                    never seen a review; but his general information was so extensive on modern topics, as to
                    induce a suspicion that he could only have collected so much information from reviews, as he
                    was never seen reading, but always idle, and in mischief, or at play. He was, however, a
                    devourer of books; he read eating, read in bed, read when no one else read, and had perused all
                    sorts of books from the time he first could spell, but had never read a review, and knew not
                    what the name implied. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap4-15"> It should be here noticed, that while he was at Harrow, his qualities were
                    rather oratorical than poetical; and if an opinion had then been formed of the likely result of
                    his character, the prognostication would have led to the expectation of an orator. Altogether,
                    his conduct at Harrow indicated a clever, but not an extraordinary boy. He formed a few <pb
                        xml:id="JG.38"/> friendships there, in which his attachment appears to have been, in some
                    instances, remarkable. The late <persName key="DuDorse4">Duke of Dorset</persName> was his fag,
                    and he was not considered a very hard taskmaster. He certainly did not carry with him from
                    Harrow any anticipation of that splendid career he was destined to run as a poet. </p>

                        >Byron</persName> spent at Harrow, while we can clearly trace the development of the
                    sensibilities of his character, and an increased tension of his susceptibility, by which
                    impressions became more acute and delicate, it seems impossible not to perceive by the records
                    which he has himself left of his feelings, that something morbid was induced upon them. Had he
                    not afterwards so magnificently distinguished himself as a poet, it is not probable that he
                    would have been recollected by his schoolfellows as having been in any respect different from
                    the common herd. His activity and spirit, in their controversies and quarrels, were but the
                    outbreakings of that temperament which the discipline of riper years, and the natural awe of
                    the world, afterward reduced into his hereditary cast of character, in which so much of
                    sullenness and misanthropy was exhibited. I cannot, however, think that there was anything
                    either in the nature of his pastimes, or his studies, unfavourable to the formation of the
                    poetical character. His amusements were active; his reading, though without method, was yet
                    congenial to his impassioned imagination; and the phantom of an enthusiastic attachment, of
                    which <persName key="MaMuste1832">Miss Chaworth</persName> was not the only object (for it was
                    altogether intellectual, and shared with others), were circum-<pb xml:id="JG.40"/>stances
                    calculated to open various sources of reflection, and to concentrate the elements of an
                    energetic and original mind. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap5-2"> But it is no easy matter to sketch what may have been the outline of a young
                    poet&#8217;s education. The supposition that poets must be dreamers, because there is often
                    much dreaminess in poesy, is a mere hypothesis. Of all the professors of metaphysical
                    discernment, poets require the finest tact; and contemplation is with them a sign of inward
                    abstract reflection, more than of any process of mind by which resemblance is traced, and
                    associations awakened. There is no account of any great poet, whose genius was of that dreamy
                    cartilaginous kind, which hath its being in haze, and draws its nourishment from lights and
                    shadows; which ponders over the mysteries of trees, and interprets the oracles of babbling
                    waters. They have all been men&#8212;worldly men, different only from others in reasoning more
                    by feeling than induction. Directed by impulse, in a greater degree than other men, poets are
                    apt to be betrayed into actions which make them singular, as compared by those who are less
                    imaginative; but the effects of earnestness should never be confounded with the qualities of
                    talent. </p>

                    is in the populous city. Inasmuch as <persName>Byron</persName> was a lover of solitude, he was
                    deficient as an observer of men. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap5-4"> The barrenest portion as to materials for biography in the life of this
                    interesting man, is the period he spent at the University of Cambridge. Like that of most young
                    men, it is probable the major part of his time was passed between the metropolis and the
                    university. Still it was in that period he composed the different poems which make up the
                    little volume of <name type="title" key="LdByron.Hours">The Hours of Idleness</name>; a work
                    which will ever be regarded, more by its consequences than its importance, as of great
                    influence on the character and career of the poet. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap5-5"> It has been supposed, I see not how justly, that there was affectation in the
                    title. It is probable that <persName key="LdByron">Byron</persName> intended no more by it than
                    to imply that its contents were sketches of leisure. This is the less doubtful, as he was at
                    that period particularly sensitive concerning the opinion that might be entertained of his
                    works. Before he made the collection, many of the pieces had been circulated, and he had
                    gathered opinions as to their merits with a degree of solicitude that can only be conceived by
                    those who were acquainted with the constantly excited sensibility of his mind. When he did
                    publish the collection, nothing appeared in the style and form of the publication that
                    indicated any arrogance of merit. On the contrary, it was brought forward with a degree of
                    diffidence, which, if it did not deserve the epithet of modesty, could incur nothing harsher
                    than that of bashfulness. It was printed at the obscure market-town press of Newark, was
                    altogether a very homely, rustic work, and no attempt was made to bespeak for it a good name
                    from the critics. It was truly an innocent affair and an unpretending performance. But
                    notwithstanding these, at least seeming, qualities of young doubtfulness and timidity, they did
                    not soften the austere nature <pb xml:id="JG.43"/> of the bleak and blighting criticism which
                    was then characteristic of Edinburgh. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap5-6"> A copy was somehow communicated to one of the <persName key="LdBroug1"
                        >critics</persName> in that city, and was reviewed by him in the <name type="title"
                        key="EdinburghRev">Edinburgh Review</name> in an <name type="title" key="LdBroug1.Byron"

                    author&#8217;s feelings, while the injustice of the estimate which was made of his talent and
                    originality, could not but be as iron in his heart. Owing to the deep and severe impression
                    which it left, it ought to be preserved in every memoir which treats of the development of his
                    genius and character; and for this reason I insert it entire, as one of the most influential
                    documents perhaps in the whole extent of biography. </p>

                            <p xml:id="chap6.1-1"> &#8220;The poesy of this young lord belongs to the class which
                                neither God nor man are said to permit. Indeed we do not recollect to have seen a
                                quantity of verse with so few deviations in either direction from that exact
                                standard. His effusions are spread over a dead flat, and can no more get above or
                                below the level than if they were so much stagnant water. As an extenuation of this
                                offence, the noble author is peculiarly forward in pleading minority. We have it in
                                the titlepage, and on the very back of the volume; it follows his name like a
                                favourite part of his <hi rend="italic">style</hi>. Much stress is laid upon it in
                                the preface; and the poems are connected with this general statement of his case by
                                particular dates, substantiating the age at which each was written. Now the law
                                upon the point of minority we hold to be perfectly clear. It is a plea available
                                only to the defendant; no plaintiff can offer it as a supplementary ground of
                                action. Thus, if any suit could be brought against <persName key="LdByron">Lord
                                    Byron</persName>, for the purpose of compelling him to put into court a certain
                                quantity of poetry, and if judgment were given against him, it is highly probable
                                that an exception would be taken, were he to deliver <hi rend="italic">for
                                    poetry</hi> the contents of this volume. To this he might plead <hi
                                    rend="italic">minority;</hi> but as he now makes voluntary tender of the
                                article, he hath <pb xml:id="JG.45"/> no right to sue on that ground for the price
                                in good current praise, should the goods be unmarketable. This is our view of the
                                law on the point; and we dare to say, so will it be ruled. Perhaps, however, in
                                reality, all that he tells us about his youth is rather with a view to increase our
                                wonder, than to soften our censures. He possibly means to say, &#8216;See how a
                                minor can write! This poem was actually composed by a young man of eighteen! and
                                this by one of only sixteen!&#8217; But, alas, we all remember the poetry of
                                    <persName key="AbCowle1667">Cowley</persName> at ten, and <persName
                                    key="AlPope1744">Pope</persName> at twelve; and, so far from hearing with any
                                degree of surprise that very poor verses were written by a youth from his leaving
                                school to his leaving college inclusive, we really believe this to be the most
                                common of all occurrences;&#8212;that it happens in the life of nine men in ten who
                                are educated in England, and that the tenth man writes better verse than
                                    <persName>Lord Byron</persName>. </p>

                            <p xml:id="chap6.1-2"> &#8220;His other plea of privilege our author brings forward to
                                waive it. He certainly, however, does allude frequently to his family and
                                ancestors, sometimes in poetry, sometimes in notes; and while giving up his claim
                                on the score of rank, he takes care to remind us of <persName key="SaJohns1784">Dr.
                                    Johnson&#8217;s</persName> saying, that when a nobleman appears as an author,
                                his merit should be handsomely acknowledged. In truth, it is this consideration
                                only that induces us to give <persName key="LdByron">Lord Byron&#8217;s</persName>
                                poems a place in our Review, besides our desire to counsel him, that he do
                                forthwith abandon poetry, and turn his talents, which are considerable, and his
                                opportunities, which are great, to better account. </p>

                            <p xml:id="chap6.1-3"> &#8220;With this view we must beg leave seriously to assure him,
                                that the mere rhyming of the final syllable, even when accompanied by the presence
                                of a certain number of feet; nay, although (which does not always happen) these
                                feet should scan regularly, and have been all counted upon the fingers, is not the
                                whole art of poetry. We would entreat him to believe, that a <pb xml:id="JG.46"/>
                                certain portion of liveliness, somewhat of fancy, is necessary to constitute a
                                poem; and that a poem in the present day, to be read, must contain at least one
                                thought, even in a little degree different from the ideas of former writers, or
                                differently expressed. We put it to his candour, whether there is anything so
                                deserving the name of poetry, in verses like the following, written in 1806, and
                                whether, if a youth of eighteen could say anything so uninteresting to his
                                ancestors, a youth of nineteen should publish it: </p>

                <p xml:id="chap6-1"> The criticism is ascribed to <persName key="FrJeffr1850">Mr. Francis
                        Jeffrey</persName>, an eloquent member of the Scottish bar, and who was at that time
                    supposed to be the editor of the <name type="title" key="EdinburghRev">Edinburgh Review</name>.
                    That it was neither just nor fair is sufficiently evident, by the degree of care and artificial
                    point with which it has been drawn up. Had the poetry been as insignificant as the critic
                    affected to consider it, it would have argued little for the judgment of <persName>Mr.
                        Jeffrey</persName>, to take so much pains on a work which he considered worthless. But the
                    world has no cause to repine at the severity of his strictures, for they unquestionably had the
                    effect of kindling the indignation of <persName key="LdByron">Byron</persName>, and of
                    instigating him to that retaliation which he so spiritedly inflicted in his satire of <name
                        type="title" key="LdByron.Bards">English Bards and Scotch Reviewers</name>. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap6-2"> It is amusing to compare the respective literary reputation of the poet and
                    the critic, as they are estimated by the public, now that the one is dead, and the other
                    dormant. The voice of all the age acknowledges <persName key="LdByron">Byron</persName> to have
                    been the greatest poetical genius of his time. <persName key="FrJeffr1850">Mr.
                        Jeffrey</persName>, though still enjoying the renown of being a shrewd and intelligent
                    critic of <pb xml:id="JG.51"/> the productions of others, has established no right to the
                    honour of being an original or eminent author. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap6-3"> At the time when <persName key="LdByron">Byron</persName> published the satire
                    alluded to, he had obtained no other distinction than the college reputation of being a clever,
                    careless, dissipated student. But his dissipation was not intense, nor did it ever become
                    habitual. He affected to be much more so than he was: his pretensions were moderated by
                    constitutional incapacity. His health was not vigorous; and his delicacy defeated his
                    endeavours to show that he inherited the recklessness of his father. He affected extravagance
                    and eccentricity of conduct, without yielding much to the one, or practising a great deal of
                    the other. He was seeking notoriety; and his attempts to obtain it gave more method to his
                    pranks and follies than belonged to the results of natural impulse and passion. He evinced
                    occasional instances of the generous spirit of youth; but there was in them more of ostentation
                    than of that discrimination which dignifies kindness, and makes prodigality munificence. Nor
                    were his attachments towards those with whom he preferred to associate, characterised by any
                    nobler sentiment than self-indulgence; he was attached, more from the pleasure he himself
                    received in their society, than from any reciprocal enjoyment they had with him. As he became a
                    man of the world, his early friends dropped from him; although it is evident, by all the
                    contemporary records of his feelings, that he cherished for them a kind, and even brotherly,
                    affection. This secession, the common effect of the new cares, hopes, interests, and wishes,
                    which young men feel on entering the world, <persName>Byron</persName> regarded as something
                    analogous to desertion; and the notion tainted his mind, and irritated that hereditary
                    sullenness of humour, which constituted an ingredient so remarkable in the composition of his
                    more mature character. </p>

                    which he scrupled not to employ in indulging it, deserves to be mentioned. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap6-5"> In repairing Newstead Abbey, a skull was found in a secret niche of the walls.
                    It might have been that of the monk who haunted the house, or of one of his own ancestors, or
                    of some victim of the morose race. It was converted into a goblet, and used at <persName
                        type="fiction">Odin</persName>-like orgies. Though the affair was but a whim of youth, more
                    odious than poetical, it caused some talk, and raised around the extravagant host the haze of a
                    mystery, suggesting fantasies of irreligion and horror. The <name type="title"

                <p xml:id="chap7-1">
                    <hi rend="small-caps">The</hi> impression which the criticism of the <name key="EdinburghRev"
                        >Edinburgh Review</name> produced upon the juvenile poet was deep and envenomed. It stung
                    his heart, and prompted him to excess. But the paroxysms did not endure long; strong volitions
                    of revenge succeeded, and the grasps of his mind were filled, as it were, with writhing adders.
                    All the world knows, that this unquenchable indignation found relief in the composition of
                    English Bards and Scotch Reviewers; a satire which, in many passages, equals, in fervour and
                    force, the most vigorous in the language. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap7-2"> It was during the summer of 1808, while the poet was residing at Newstead,
                    that <name type="title" key="LdByron.Bards">English Bards and Scotch Reviewers</name> was
                    principally written. He bestowed more pains upon it than perhaps on any other of his works;
                    and, though different from them all, it still exhibits strong indications of the misanthropy
                    with which, after quitting Cambridge, he became more and more possessed. It is painful to
                    reflect, in considering the splendid energy displayed in the poem, that the unprovoked malice
                    which directed him to make the satire so general, was, perhaps, the main cause of that
                    disposition to wither his reputation, which was afterwards so fervently roused. He could not
                    but <pb xml:id="JG.54"/> expect, that, in stigmatizing with contempt and ridicule so many
                    persons by name, some of them would retaliate. Nor could he complain of injustice if they did;
                    for his attack was so wilful, that the rage of it can only be explained by supposing he was
                    instigated to &#8220;the one fell swoop,&#8221; by a resentful conviction, that his impillory
                    in the <name type="title">Edinburgh Review</name> had amused them all. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap7-3"> I do not conceive, that the generality of the satire can be well extenuated;
                    but I am not inclined to regard it as having been a very heinous offence. The ability displayed
                    in it is a sufficient compensation. The beauty of the serpent&#8217;s skin appeases the
                    aversion to its nature. Moreover, a toothless satire is verse without poetry&#8212;the most
                    odious of all respectable things. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap7-4"> But, without regard to the merits or delinquency of the poem, to the acumen of
                    its animadversions, or to the polish of the lines, it possesses, in the biography of the
                    author, a value of the most interesting kind. It was the first burst of that dark, diseased
                    ichor, which afterwards coloured his effusions; the overflowing suppuration of that satiety and
                    loathing, which rendered <name type="title" key="LdByron.Harold">Childe Harold</name>, in
                    particular, so original, incomprehensible, and antisocial; and bears testimony to the state of
                    his feelings at that important epoch, while he was yet upon the threshold of the world, and was
                    entering it with a sense of failure and humiliation, and premature disgust. For,
                    notwithstanding his unnecessary expositions concerning his dissipation, it is beyond
                    controversy, that at no time could it be said he was a dissipated young man. That he indulged
                    in occasional excesses is true; but his habits were never libertine, nor did his health or
                    stamina permit him to be distinguished in licentiousness. The declaration in which he first
                    discloses his sobriety, contains more truth than all his pretensions to his father&#8217;s
                    qualities. <q>&#8220;I took my gradations in the vices,&#8221; says he, in that remarkable
                        confession, &#8220;with great promptitude, but they were not to my taste; for my early
                        passions, though <pb xml:id="JG.55"/> violent in the extreme, were concentrated, and hated
                        division or spreading abroad. I could have left or lost the whole world with or for that
                        which I loved; but, though my temperament was naturally burning, I could not share in the
                        common libertinism of the place and time without disgust; and yet this very disgust, and my
                        heart thrown back upon itself, threw me into excesses perhaps more fatal than those from
                        which I shrunk, as fixing upon one at a time the passions, which, spread among many, would
                        have hurt only myself.&#8221;</q> This is vague and metaphysical enough; but it bears
                    corroborative intimations, that the impression which he early made upon me was not incorrect.
                    He was vain of his experiments in profligacy, but they never grew to habitude. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap7-5"> While he was engaged in the composition of his satire, he formed a plan of
                    travelling; but there was a great shortcoming between the intention and the performance. He
                    first thought of Persia; he afterwards resolved to sail for India; and had so far matured this
                    project, as to write for information to the <persName key="JoPalme1840">Arabic
                        professor</persName> at Cambridge; and to his mother, who was not then with him at
                    Newstead, to inquire of a friend, who had resided in India, what things would be necessary for
                    the voyage. He formed his plan of travelling upon different reasons from those which he
                    afterward gave out, and which have been imputed to him. He then thought that all men should in
                    some period of their lives travel; he had at that time no tie to prevent him; he conceived that
                    when he returned home he might be induced to enter into political life, to which his having
                    travelled would be an advantage; and he wished to know the world by sight, and to judge of men
                    by experience. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap7-6"> When his satire was ready for the press, he carried it with him to London. He
                    was then just come of age, or about to be so; and one of his objects in this visit to the
                    metropolis was, to take his seat in the House of <pb xml:id="JG.56"/> Lords before going
                    abroad; but, in advancing to this proud distinction, so soothing to the self-importance of
                    youth, he was destined to suffer a mortification which probably wounded him as deeply as the
                    sarcasms of the <name type="title" key="EdinburghRev">Edinburgh Review</name>. Before the
                    meeting of Parliament, he wrote to his relation and guardian, the <persName key="LdCarli5">Earl
                        of Carlisle</persName>, to remind him that he should be of age at the commencement of the
                    Session, in the natural hope that his Lordship would make an offer to introduce him to the
                    House, but he was disappointed. He only received a formal reply, acquainting him with the
                    technical mode of proceeding, and the etiquette to be observed on such occasions. It is
                    therefore not wonderful that he should have resented such treatment; and he avenged it by those
                    lines in his satire, for which he afterwards expressed his regret in the third canto of <name
                        type="title" key="LdByron.Harold">Childe Harold</name>. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap7-8"> Deserted by his guardian at a crisis so interesting, he was prevented for some
                    time from taking his seat in Parliament; being obliged to procure affidavits in proof of his
                        <persName key="JoByron1786">grandfather&#8217;s</persName> marriage with <persName
                        key="SoByron1758">Miss Trevannion</persName>, which having taken place in a private chapel
                    at Carhais, no regular certificate of the ceremony could be produced. At length, all the
                    necessary evidence having been obtained, on the 13th of March, 1809, he presented himself in
                    the House of Lords alone&#8212;a proceeding consonant to his character, for he was not so
                    friendless nor unknown, but that he might have procured some peer to have gone with him. It,
                    however, served to make his introduction remarkable. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap7-9"> On entering the House, he is described to have appeared abashed and pale: he
                    passed the woolsack without looking round, and advanced to the table where the proper officer
                    was attending to administer the oaths. When he had gone through them, the chancellor quitted
                    his seat, and went towards him with a smile, putting out his hand in a friendly manner to
                    welcome him, but he made a stiff bow, and only touched with <pb xml:id="JG.57"/> the tip of his
                    fingers the chancellor&#8217;s hand, who immediately returned to his seat. Such is the account
                    given of this important incident by <persName key="RoDalla1824">Mr. Dallas</persName>, who went
                    with him to the bar; but a characteristic circumstance is wanting. When <persName
                        key="LdEldon1">Lord Eldon</persName> advanced with the cordiality described, he expressed
                    with becoming courtesy his regret that the rules of the House had obliged him to call for the
                    evidence of his grandfather&#8217;s marriage.&#8212;<q>&#8220;Your Lordship has done your duty,
                        and no more,&#8221;</q> was the cold reply, in the words of <persName type="fiction">Tom
                        Thumb</persName>, and which probably was the cause of the marked manner of the
                    chancellor&#8217;s cool return to his seat. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap7-10"> The satire was published anonymously, and immediately attracted attention;
                    the sale was rapid, and a new edition being called for, <persName key="LdByron"
                        >Byron</persName> revised it. The preparations for his travels being completed, he then
                    embarked in July of the same year, with <persName key="JoHobho1869">Mr. Hobhouse</persName>,
                    for Lisbon, and thence proceeded by the southern provinces of Spain to Gibraltar. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap7-11"> In the account of his adventures during this journey, he seems to have felt,
                    to an exaggerated degree, the hazards to which he was exposed. But many of his descriptions are
                    given with a bright pen. That of Lisbon has always been admired for its justness, and the
                    mixture of force and familiarity. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap7-12"> Considering the interest which he afterwards took in the affairs of Greece,
                    it is remarkable that he should have passed through Spain, at the period he has described,
                    without feeling any sympathy with the spirit which then animated that nation. Intent, however,
                    on his travels, pressing onward to an unknown goal, he paused not to inquire as to the
                    earnestness of the patriotic zeal of the Spaniards, nor once dreamed, even for adventure, of
                    taking a part in their heroic cause. </p>

                <l rend="head2"> First acquaintance with <persName>Byron</persName>.&#8212;Embark
                    together.&#8212;The voyage. </l>

                <p xml:id="chap8-1"> It was at Gibraltar that I first fell in with <persName key="LdByron">Lord
                        Byron</persName>. I had arrived there in the packet from England, in indifferent health, on
                    my way to Sicily. I had then no intention of travelling. I only went a trip, intending to
                    return home after spending a few weeks in Malta, Sicily, and Sardinia; having, before my
                    departure, entered into the Society of Lincoln&#8217;s Inn, with the design of studying the
                    law. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap8-2"> At this time, my friend, the late <persName key="ClWrigh1808">Colonel
                        Wright</persName>, of the artillery, was secretary to the Governor; and during the short
                    stay of the packet at the Rock, he invited me to the hospitalities of his house, and among
                    other civilities gave me admission to the garrison library. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap8-3"> The day, I well remember, was exceedingly sultry. The air was sickly; and if
                    the wind was not a sirocco, it was a withering levanter&#8212;oppressive to the functions of
                    life, and to an invalid denying all exercise. Instead of rambling over the fortifications, I
                    was, in consequence, constrained to spend the hottest part of the day in the library; and,
                    while sitting there, a young man came in and seated himself opposite to me at the table where I
                    was reading. Something in his appearance attracted my attention. His dress indicated a Londoner
                    of some fashion, partly by its neatness and <pb xml:id="JG.60"/> simplicity, with just so much
                    of a peculiarity of style as served to show, that although he belonged to the order of
                    metropolitan beaux, he was not altogether a common one. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap8-4"> I thought his face not unknown to me; I began to conjecture where I could have
                    seen him; and, after an unobserved scrutiny, to speculate both as to his character and
                    vocation. His physiognomy was prepossessing and intelligent, but ever and anon his brows
                    lowered and gathered; a habit, as I then thought, with a degree of affectation in it, probably
                    first assumed for picturesque effect and energetic expression; but which I afterwards
                    discovered was undoubtedly the occasional scowl of some unpleasant reminiscence: it was
                    certainly disagreeable&#8212;forbidding&#8212;but still the general cast of his features was
                    impressed with elegance and character. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap8-5"> At dinner, a large party assembled at <persName key="ClWrigh1808">Colonel
                        Wright&#8217;s</persName>; among others the <persName key="LyWestm10">Countess of
                        Westmorland</persName>, with <persName key="ThSheri1817">Tom Sheridan</persName> and his
                        <persName key="CaSheri1851">beautiful wife</persName>; and it happened that
                        <persName>Sheridan</persName>, in relating the local news of the morning, mentioned that
                        <persName key="LdByron">Lord Byron</persName> and <persName key="JoHobho1869">Mr.
                        Hobhouse</persName> had come in from Spain, and were to proceed up the Mediterranean in the
                    packet. He was not acquainted with either. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap8-6">
                    <persName key="JoHobho1869">Hobhouse</persName> had, a short time before I left London,
                    published certain translations and <name type="title" key="JoHobho1869.Imitations">poems</name>
                    rather respectable in their way, and I had seen the work, so that his name was not altogether
                    strange to me. <persName key="LdByron">Byron&#8217;s</persName> was familiar&#8212;the <name
                        type="title" key="EdinburghRev">Edinburgh Review</name> had made it so, and still more the
                    satire of <name type="title" key="LdByron.Bards">English Bards and Scotch Reviewers</name>, but
                    I was not conscious of having seen the persons of either. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap8-7"> On the following evening I embarked early, and soon after the two travellers
                    came on board; in one of whom I recognised the visitor to the library, and he proved to be
                        <persName key="LdByron">Lord Byron</persName>. In the little bustle and process of
                    embarking their luggage, his Lordship affected, <pb xml:id="JG.61"/> as it seemed to me, more
                    aristocracy than befitted his years, or the occasion; and I then thought of his singular scowl,
                    and suspected him of pride and irascibility. The impression that evening was not agreeable, but
                    it was interesting; and that forehead mark, the frown, was calculated to awaken curiosity, and
                    beget conjectures. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap8-8">
                    <persName key="JoHobho1869">Hobhouse</persName>, with more of the commoner, made himself one of
                    the passengers at once; but <persName key="LdByron">Byron</persName> held himself aloof, and
                    sat on the rail, leaning on the mizzen shrouds, inhaling, as it were, poetical sympathy, from
                    the gloomy Rock, then dark and stern in the twilight. There was in all about him that evening
                    much waywardness; he spoke petulantly to <persName key="WiFletc1831">Fletcher</persName>, his
                    valet; and was evidently ill at ease with himself, and fretful towards others. I thought he
                    would turn out an unsatisfactory shipmate; yet there was something redeeming in the tones of
                    his voice, when, some time after he had indulged his sullen meditation, he again addressed
                        <persName>Fletcher</persName>; so that, instead of finding him ill-natured, I was soon
                    convinced he was only capricious. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap8-9"> Our passage to Sardinia was tardy, owing to calms; but, in other respects,
                    pleasant. About the third day <persName key="LdByron">Byron</persName> relented from his rapt
                    mood, as if he felt it was out of place, and became playful, and disposed to contribute his
                    fair proportion to the general endeavour to wile away the tediousness of the dull voyage. Among
                    other expedients for that purpose, we had recourse to shooting at bottles.
                        <persName>Byron</persName>, I think, supplied the pistols, and was the best shot, but not
                    very pre-eminently so. In the calms, the jolly-boat was several times lowered; and, on one of
                    those occasions, his Lordship, with the captain, caught a turtle&#8212;I rather think
                    two&#8212;we likewise hooked a shark, part of which was dressed for breakfast, and tasted,
                    without relish; your shark is but a cannibal dainty. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap8-10"> As we approached the gulf, or bay, of Cagliari, in <pb xml:id="JG.62"/>
                    Sardinia, a strong north wind came from the shore, and we had a whole disagreeable day of
                    tacking, but next morning, it was Sunday, we found ourselves at anchor near the mole, where we
                    landed. <persName key="LdByron">Byron</persName>, with the captain, rode out some distance into
                    the country, while I walked with <persName key="JoHobho1869">Mr. Hobhouse</persName> about the
                    town: we left our cards for the consul, and <persName key="LdBerwi3">Mr. Hill</persName>, the
                    ambassador, who invited us to dinner. In the evening we landed again, to avail ourselves of the
                    invitation; and, on this occasion, <persName>Byron</persName> and his <persName type="fiction"
                        >Pylades</persName> dressed themselves as aides-de-camp&#8212;a circumstance which, at the
                    time, did not tend to improve my estimation of the solidity of the character of either. But
                    such is the force of habit: it appeared a less exceptionable affectation in the young peer than
                    in the commoner. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap8-11"> Had we parted at Cagliari, it is probable that I should have retained a much
                    more favourable recollection of <persName key="JoHobho1869">Mr. Hobhouse</persName> than of
                        <persName key="LdByron">Lord Byron</persName>; for he was a cheerful companion, full of odd
                    and droll stories, which he told extremely well; he was also good-humoured and
                    intelligent&#8212;altogether an advantageous specimen of a well-educated English gentleman.
                    Moreover, I was at the time afflicted with a nervous dejection, which the occasional
                    exhilaration produced by his anecdotes and college tales often materially dissipated, though,
                    for the most part, they were more after the manner and matter of <persName key="JoSwift1745"
                        >Swift</persName> than of <persName key="JoAddis1719">Addison</persName>. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap8-12">
                    <persName key="LdByron">Byron</persName> was, during the passage, in delicate health, and upon
                    an abstemious regimen. He rarely tasted wine, nor more than half a glass, mingled with water,
                    when he did. He ate little; no animal food, but only bread and vegetables. He reminded me of
                    the ghoul that picked rice with a needle; for it was manifest, that he had not acquired his
                    knowledge of the world by always dining so sparely. If my remembrance is not treacherous, he
                    only spent one evening in the cabin with us&#8212;the evening before we came to anchor at
                    Cagliari; for, when the lights were placed, he made him-<pb xml:id="JG.63"/>self a man forbid,
                    took his station on the railing between the pegs on which the sheets are belayed and the
                    shrouds, and there, for hours, sat in silence, enamoured, it may be, of the moon. All these
                    peculiarities, with his caprices, and something inexplicable in the cast of his metaphysics,
                    while they served to awaken interest, contributed little to conciliate esteem. He was often
                    strangely rapt&#8212;it may have been from his genius; and, had its grandeur and darkness been
                    then divulged, susceptible of explanation; but, at the time, it threw, as it were, around him
                    the sackcloth of penitence. Sitting amid the shrouds and rattlins, in the tranquillity of the
                    moonlight, churming an inarticulate melody, he seemed almost apparitional, suggesting dim
                    reminiscences of him who shot the albatross. He was as a mystery in a winding-sheet, crowned
                    with a halo. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap8-13"> The influence of the incomprehensible phantasma which hovered about <persName
                        key="LdByron">Lord Byron</persName> has been more or less felt by all who ever approached
                    him. That he sometimes came out of the cloud, and was familiar and earthly, is true; but his
                    dwelling was amid the murk and the mist, and the home of his spirit in the abysm of the storm,
                    and the hiding-places of guilt. He was, at the time of which I am speaking, scarcely
                    two-and-twenty, and could claim no higher praise than having written a clever worldly-minded
                    satire; and yet it was impossible, even then, to reflect on the bias of his mind, as it was
                    revealed by the casualties of conversation, without experiencing a presentiment, that he was
                    destined to execute some singular and ominous purpose. The description he has given of
                        <persName type="fiction">Manfred</persName> in his youth was of himself. </p>

                <l rend="head2"> Dinner at the ambassador&#8217;s.&#8212;Opera.&#8212;Disaster of
                        <persName>Byron</persName> at Malta.&#8212;<persName>Mrs. Spencer Smith</persName>. </l>

                <p xml:id="chap9-1">
                    <hi rend="small-caps">I shall</hi> always remember Cagliari with particular pleasure; for it so
                    happened that I formed there three of the most agreeable acquaintances of my life, and one of
                    them was with <persName key="LdByron">Lord Byron</persName>; for although we had been eight
                    days together, I yet could not previously have accounted myself acquainted with his Lordship. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap9-2"> After dinner, we all went to the theatre, which was that evening, on account
                    of some court festival, brilliantly illuminated. The Royal Family were present, and the opera
                    was performed with more taste and execution than I had expected to meet with in so remote a
                    place, and under the restrictions which rendered the intercourse with the continent then so
                    difficult. Among other remarkable characters pointed out to us was a nobleman in the pit,
                    actually under the ban of outlawry for murder. I have often wondered if the incident had any
                    effect on the creation of <name type="title" key="LdByron.Lara">Lara</name>; for we know not in
                    what small germs the conceptions of genius originate. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap9-3"> But the most important occurrence of that evening arose from a delicate
                    observance of etiquette on the part of the <persName key="LdBerwi3">ambassador</persName>.
                    After carrying us to his box, which was close to that of the Royal Family, in order that we
                    might see the members of it properly, he retired with <persName key="LdByron">Lord
                        Byron</persName> to another box, an inflexion of <pb xml:id="JG.66"/> manners to propriety
                    in the best possible taste&#8212;for the ambassador was doubtless aware that his
                    Lordship&#8217;s rank would be known to the audience, and I conceive that this little
                    arrangement was adopted to make his person also known, by showing him with distinction apart
                    from the other strangers. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap9-4"> When the performance was over, <persName key="LdBerwi3">Mr. Hill</persName>
                    came down with <persName key="LdByron">Lord Byron</persName> to the gate of the upper town,
                    where his Lordship, as we were taking leave, thanked him with more elocution than was precisely
                    requisite. The style and formality of the speech amused <persName key="JoHobho1869">Mr.
                        Hobhouse</persName>, as well as others; and, when the minister retired, he began to rally
                    his Lordship on the subject. But <persName>Byron</persName> really fancied that he had
                    acquitted himself with grace and dignity, and took the jocularity of his friend amiss&#8212;a
                    little banter ensued&#8212;the poet became petulant, and <persName>Mr. Hobhouse</persName>
                    walked on; while <persName>Byron</persName>, on account of his lameness, and the roughness of
                    the pavement, took hold of my arm, appealing to me, if he could have said less, after the kind
                    and hospitable treatment we had all received. Of course, though I thought pretty much as
                        <persName>Mr. Hobhouse</persName> did, I could not do otherwise than civilly assent,
                    especially as his Lordship&#8217;s comfort, at the moment, seemed in some degree dependent on
                    being confirmed in the good opinion he was desirous to entertain of his own courtesy. From that
                    night I evidently rose in his good graces; and, as he was always most agreeable and interesting
                    when familiar, it was worth my while to advance, but by cautious circumvallations, into his
                    intimacy; for his uncertain temper made his favour precarious. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap9-5"> The next morning, either owing to the relaxation of his abstinence, which he
                    could not probably well avoid amid the good things of the ambassadorial table; or, what was,
                    perhaps, less questionable, some regret for his petulance towards his friend, he was
                    indisposed, and did not make his appearance till late in <pb xml:id="JG.67"/> the evening. I
                    rather suspect, though there was no evidence of the fact, that <persName key="JoHobho1869"
                        >Hobhouse</persName> received any concession which he may have made with indulgence; for he
                    remarked to me, in a tone that implied both forbearance and generosity of regard, that it was
                    necessary to humour him like a child. But, in whatever manner the reconciliation was
                    accomplished, the passengers partook of the blessings of the peace. <persName key="LdByron"
                        >Byron</persName>, during the following day, as we were sailing along the picturesque
                    shores of Sicily, was in the highest spirits overflowing with glee, and sparkling with quaint
                    sentences. The champagne was uncorked and in the finest condition. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap9-6"> Having landed the mail at Girgenti, we stretched over to Malta, where we
                    arrived about noon next day&#8212;all the passengers, except <persName type="fiction"
                        >Orestes</persName> and <persName type="fiction">Pylades</persName>, being eager to land,
                    went on shore with the captain. They remained behind for a reason&#8212;which an accidental
                    expression of <persName key="LdByron">Byron</persName> let out&#8212;much to my secret
                    amusement; for I was aware they would be disappointed, and the anticipation was relishing. They
                    expected&#8212;at least he did&#8212;a salute from the batteries, and sent ashore notice to
                        <persName key="AlBall1809">Sir Alexander Ball</persName>, the Governor, of his arrival; but
                    the guns were sulky, and evinced no respect of persons; so that late in the afternoon, about
                    the heel of the evening, the two magnates were obliged to come on shore, and slip into the city
                    unnoticed and unknown. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap9-7"> At this time Malta was in great prosperity. Her commerce was flourishing; and
                    the goodly clusters of its profits hung ripe and rich at every door. The merchants were truly
                    hospitable, and few more so than <persName key="JaChabo1850">Mr. Chabot</persName>. As I had
                    letters to him, he invited me to dinner, along with several other friends previously engaged.
                    In the cool of the evening, as we were sitting at our wine, <persName key="LdByron">Lord
                        Byron</persName> and <persName key="JoHobho1869">Mr. Hobhouse</persName> were announced.
                    His Lordship was in better spirits than I had ever seen him. His appearance <pb xml:id="JG.68"
                    /> showed, as he entered the room, that they had met with some adventure, and he chuckled with
                    an inward sense of enjoyment, not altogether without spleen&#8212;a kind of malicious
                    satisfaction&#8212;as his companion recounted with all becoming gravity their woes and
                    sufferings, as an apology for begging a bed and morsel for the night. God forgive me! but I
                    partook of <persName>Byron&#8217;s</persName> levity at the idea of personages so consequential
                    wandering destitute in the streets, seeking for lodgings, as it were, from door to door, and
                    rejected at all. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap9-8"> Next day, however, they were accommodated by the <persName key="AlBall1809"
                        >Governor</persName> with an agreeable house in the upper part of Valetta; and his
                    Lordship, as soon as they were domiciled, began to take lessons in Arabic from a monk&#8212;I
                    believe one of the librarians of the public library. His whole time was not, however, devoted
                    to study; for he formed an acquaintance with <persName key="CoSmith1829">Mrs. Spencer
                        Smith</persName>, the lady of the gentleman of that name, who had been our resident
                    minister at Constantinople: he affected a passion for her; but it was only Platonic. She,
                    however, beguiled him of his valuable yellow diamond-ring. She is the <persName type="fiction"
                        >Florence</persName> of <name type="title" key="LdByron.Harold">Childe Harold</name>, and
                    merited the poetical embalmment, or rather the amber immortalization, she possesses
                    there&#8212;being herself a heroine. There was no exaggeration in saying that many incidents of
                    her life would appear improbable in fiction. Her adventures with the <persName
                        key="CaSalvo1860">Marquis de Salvo</persName> form one of the prettiest romances in the
                    Italian language; everything in her destiny was touched with adventure: nor was it the least of
                    her claims to sympathy that she had incurred the special enmity of <persName key="Napoleon1"
                        >Napoleon</persName>. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap9-9"> After remaining about three weeks at Malta, <persName key="LdByron"
                        >Byron</persName> embarked with his friend in a brig of war, appointed to convoy a fleet of
                    small merchantmen to Prevesa. I had, about a fortnight before, passed over with the packet on
                    her return from Messina to Girgenti, and did not fall in with them again till the following
                    spring, <pb xml:id="JG.69"/> when we met at Athens. In the meantime, besides his Platonic
                    dalliance with <persName key="CoSmith1829">Mrs. Spencer Smith</persName>,
                        <persName>Byron</persName> had involved himself in a quarrel with an <persName
                        key="CpCary1809">officer</persName>; but it was satisfactorily settled. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap9-10"> His residence at Malta did not greatly interest him. The story of its
                    chivalrous masters made no impression on his imagination&#8212;none that appears in his
                    works&#8212;but it is not the less probable that the remembrance of the place itself occupied a
                    deep niche in his bosom: for I have remarked, that he had a voluntary power of forgetfulness,
                    which, on more than one occasion, struck me as singular: and I am led in consequence to think,
                    that something unpleasant, connected with this quarrel, may have been the cause of his
                    suppression of all direct allusion to the island. It was impossible that his imagination could
                    avoid the impulses of the spirit which haunts the walls and ramparts of Malta; and the silence
                    of his muse on a topic so rich in romance, and so well calculated to awaken associations
                    concerning the knights, in unison with the ruminations of <persName type="fiction">Childe
                        Harold</persName>, persuades me that there must have been some specific cause for the
                    omission. If it were nothing in the duel, I should be inclined to say, notwithstanding the
                    seeming improbability of the notion, that it was owing to some curious modification of
                    vindictive spite. It might not be that Malta should receive no celebrity from his pen; but
                    assuredly he had met with something there which made him resolute to forget the place. The
                    question as to what it was, he never answered: the result would throw light into the labyrinths
                    of his character. </p>

                    walked for some time among the currant grounds between the town and the shore. Around him lay
                    one of the noblest landscapes in the world, and afar in the north-east rose the purple summits

                    disappointment, as he passed its cliffy shores, was then in the possession of the French. In

                <p xml:id="chap10-7"> In this journey he was still accompanied by <persName key="JoHobho1869">Mr.
                        Hobhouse</persName>. They had provided themselves with a Greek to serve as a dragoman. With
                    this person they soon became dissatisfied, in consequence of their general suspicion of Greek
                    integrity, and because of the necessary influence which such an appendage acquires in the
                    exercise of his office. He is the tongue and purse-bearer of his master; he procures him
                    lodging, food, horses, and all conveniences; must support his dignity with the Turks&#8212;a
                    difficult task in those days for a Greek&#8212;and his manifold trusts demand that he should be
                    not only active and ingenious, but prompt and resolute. In the qualifications of this essential
                    servant, the tra-<pb xml:id="JG.73"/>vellers were not fortunate&#8212;he never lost an
                    opportunity of pilfering;&#8212;he was, however, zealous, bustling, and talkative, and withal
                    good-humoured; and, having his mind intent on one object&#8212;making money&#8212;was never
                    lazy nor drunken, negligent nor unprepared. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap10-8"> On the 1st of October they embarked, and sailed up the Gulf of Salona, where
                    they were shown into an empty barrack for lodgings. In this habitation twelve Albanian soldiers
                    and an officer were quartered, who behaved towards them with civility. On their entrance, the
                    officer gave them pipes and coffee, and after they had dined in their own apartment, he invited
                    them to spend the evening with him, and they condescended to partake of his hospitality. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap10-9"> Such instances as these in ordinary biography would be without interest; but
                    when it is considered how firmly the impression of them was retained in the mind of the poet,
                    and how intimately they entered into the substance of his reminiscences of Greece, they acquire
                    dignity, and become epochal in the history of the development of his intellectual powers. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap10-10">
                    <q>&#8220;All the Albanians,&#8221; says <persName key="JoHobho1869">Mr. Hobhouse</persName>,
                        &#8220;strut very much when they walk, projecting their chests, throwing back their heads,
                        and moving very slowly from side to side. <persName>Elmas</persName> (as the officer was
                        called) had this strut more than any man perhaps we saw afterwards; and as the sight was
                        then quite new to us, we could not help staring at the magisterial and superlatively
                        dignified air of a man with great holes in his elbows, and looking altogether, as to his
                        garment, like what we call a bull-beggar.&#8221;</q>&#160;<persName>Mr. Hobhouse</persName>
                    describes him as a captain, but by the number of men under him, he could have been of no higher
                    rank than serjeant. Captains are centurions. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap10-11"> After supper, the officer washed his hands with soap, inviting the
                    travellers to do the same, for they had eaten a little with him; he did not, however, give the
                    soap, but put it on the floor with an air so remark-<pb xml:id="JG.74"/>able, as to induce
                        <persName key="JoHobho1869">Mr. Hobhouse</persName> to inquire the meaning of it, and he
                    was informed that there is a superstition in Turkey against giving soap: it is thought it will
                    wash away love. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap10-12"> Next day it rained, and the travellers were obliged to remain under shelter.
                    The evening was again spent with the soldiers, who did their utmost to amuse them with Greek
                    and Albanian songs and freaks of jocularity. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap10-13"> In the morning of the 3d of October they set out for Arta, with ten horses;
                    four for themselves and servants, four for their luggage, and two for two soldiers whom they
                    were induced to take with them as guards. <persName key="LdByron">Byron</persName> takes no
                    notice of his visit to Arta in <name type="title" key="LdByron.Harold">Childe Harold</name>;
                    but <persName key="JoHobho1869">Mr. Hobhouse</persName> has given a minute account of the town.
                    They met there with nothing remarkable. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap10-14"> The remainder of the journey to Joannina, the capital then of the famous
                        <persName key="AliPasha">Ali Pashaw</persName>, was rendered unpleasant by the wetness of
                    the weather; still it was impossible to pass through a country so picturesque in its features,
                    and rendered romantic by the traditions of robberies and conflicts, without receiving
                    impressions of that kind of imagery which constitutes the embroidery on the vestment of poetry. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap10-15"> The first view of Joannina seen in the morning light, or glittering in the
                    setting sun, is lively and alluring. The houses, domes, and minarets, shining through gardens
                    of orange and lemon trees and groves of cypresses; the lake, spreading its broad mirror at the
                    foot of the town, and the mountains rising abrupt around, all combined to present a landscape
                    new and beautiful. Indeed, where may be its parallel? the lake was the Acherusian, Mount Pindus
                    was in sight, and the Elysian fields of mythology spread in the lovely plains over which they
                    passed in approaching the town. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap10-16"> On entering Joannina, they were appalled by a spectacle characteristic of
                    the country. Opposite a butcher&#8217;s <pb xml:id="JG.75"/> shop, they beheld hanging from the
                    boughs of a tree a man&#8217;s arm, with part of the side torn from the body.&#8212;How long is
                    it since Temple-bar, in the very heart of London, was adorned with the skulls of the Scottish
                    noblemen who were beheaded for their loyalty to the son and representative of their ancient
                    kings! </p>

                <p xml:id="chap10-17"> The object of the visit to Joannina was to see <persName key="AliPasha">Ali
                        Pashaw</persName>, in those days the most celebrated vizier in all the western provinces of
                    the Ottoman empire; but he was then at Tepellen&#233;. The luxury of resting, however, in a
                    capital, was not to be resisted, and they accordingly suspended their journey until they had
                    satisfied their curiosity with an inspection of every object which merited attention. Of
                    Joannina, it may be said, they were almost the discoverers, so little was known of it in
                    England&#8212;I may say in Western Europe&#8212;previous to their visit. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap10-18"> The palace and establishment of <persName key="AliPasha">Ali
                        Pashaw</persName> were of regal splendour, combining with oriental pomp the elegance of the
                    occident, and the travellers were treated by the vizier&#8217;s officers with all the courtesy
                    due to the rank of <persName key="LdByron">Lord Byron</persName>, and every facility was
                    afforded them to prosecute their journey. The weather, however&#8212;the season being far
                    advanced&#8212;was wet and unsettled, and they suffered more fatigue and annoyance than
                    travellers for information or pleasure should have had to encounter. </p>

                    considerable stream, as large as the Avon at Bath but towards the evening they had some cause
                    to think the Acheron had not lost all its original horror; for a dreadful thunderstorm came on,
                    accompanied with deluges of rain, which more than once nearly carried away their luggage and
                    horses. <persName key="LdByron">Byron</persName> himself does not notice this incident in <name

                    terrific which he met with alone in similar circumstances on the night before their arrival at
                    Zitza, when his guides lost their way in the defiles of the mountains&#8212;adventures
                    sufficiently disagreeable in the advent, but full of poesy in the remembrance. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap11-4"> The first halt, after leaving Zitza, was at the little village of Mosure,
                    where they were lodged in a miserable cabin, the residence of a poor priest, who treated them
                    with all the kindness his humble means afforded. From this place they proceeded next morning
                    through a wild and savage country, interspersed with vineyards, to Delvinaki, where it would
                    seem they first met with genuine Greek wine, that is, wine mixed with resin and lime&#8212;a
                    more odious draught at the first taste than any drug the apothecary mixes. Considering how much
                    of allegory entered into the composition of the <pb xml:id="JG.79"/> Greek mythology, it is
                    probable that in representing the infant <persName type="fiction">Bacchus</persName> holding a
                    pine, the ancient sculptors intended an impersonation of the circumstance of resin being
                    employed to preserve new wine. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap11-5"> The travellers were now in Albania, the native region of <persName

                    entering the town, they were informed that he was further up the country at Tepellen&#233;, or
                    Tepalen, his native place. In their route from Libokavo to Tepalen they met with no adventure,
                    nor did they visit Argyro-castro, which they saw some nine or ten miles off&#8212;a large city,
                    supposed to contain about twenty thousand inhabitants, chiefly Turks. When they reached
                    Cezarades, a distance of not more than nine miles, which had taken them five hours to travel,
                    they were agreeably accommodated for the night in a neat cottage; and the Albanian landlord, in
                    whose demeanour they could discern none of that cringing, downcast, sinister look which marked
                    the degraded Greek, received them with a hearty welcome. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap11-6"> Next morning they resumed their journey, and halted one night more before
                    they reached Tepellen&#233;, in approaching which they met a carriage, not inelegantly
                    constructed after the German fashion, with a man on the box driving four-in-hand, and two
                    Albanian soldiers standing on the footboard behind. They were floundering on at a trot through

                    impossible that such a vehicle should ever be able to reach Libokavo, to which it was bound. In
                    due time they crossed the river Laos, or Voioutza, which was then full, and appeared both to

                <p xml:id="chap11-8"> The peculiar quietness and ease with which the Mahommedans say their prayers,
                    struck the travellers as one of the most peculiar characteristics which they had yet witnessed
                    of that people. Some of the <pb xml:id="JG.81"/> graver sort began their devotions in the
                    places where they were sitting, undisturbed and unnoticed by those around them who were
                    otherwise engaged. The prayers last about ten minutes; they are not uttered aloud, but
                    generally in a low voice, sometimes with only a motion of the lips; and, whether performed in
                    the public street or in a room, attract no attention from the bystanders. Of more than a
                    hundred of the guards in the gallery of the vizier&#8217;s mansion at Tepellen&#233;, not more
                    than five or six were seen at prayers. The Albanians are not reckoned strict Mahommedans; but
                    no Turk, however irreligious himself, ever disturbs the devotion of others. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap11-9"> It was then the fast of Ramazan, and the travellers, during the night, were
                    annoyed with the perpetual noise of the carousal kept up in the gallery, and by the drum, and
                    the occasional voice of the Muezzin. </p>

                    the poetry, and ensure for themselves an interest as lasting as it is intense. When the manners
                    and customs of the inhabitants shall have been changed by time and the vicissitudes of society,

                    the vizier for their first audience; and about noon, the time appointed, an officer of the
                    palace with a white wand announced to them that his highness was ready to receive them, and
                    accordingly they proceeded from their own apartment, accompanied by the secretary of the
                    vizier, and attended by their own dragoman. The usher of the white rod led the way, and
                    conducted them through a suite of meanly-furnished apartments to the presence chamber.
                        <persName key="AliPasha">Ali</persName> when they entered was standing, a courtesy of
                    marked distinction from a Turk. As they advanced towards him, he seated himself, and requested
                    them to sit near <pb xml:id="JG.83"/> him. The room was spacious and handsomely fitted up,
                    surrounded by that species of continued sofa which the upholsterers call a divan, covered with
                    richly-embroidered velvet; in the middle of the floor was a large marble basin, in which a

                <p xml:id="chap12-3"> When this was written <persName key="AliPasha">Ali Pashaw</persName> was
                    still living; but the prediction which it implies was soon after verified, and he closed his
                    stern and energetic life with a catastrophe worthy of its guilt and bravery. He voluntarily
                    perished by firing a powder-magazine, when surrounded, beyond all chance of escape, by the
                    troops of the sultan his master, whose authority he had long contemned. </p>

                    <persName key="JoHobho1869">Mr. Hobhouse</persName> describes him at this audience as a short
                    fat man, about five feet five inches in height; with a very pleasing face, fair and round; and
                    blue fair eyes, not settled into a Turkish gravity. His beard was long and hoary, and such a
                    one as any other Turk would have been proud of; nevertheless, he, who was more occupied in
                    attending to his guests than him-<pb xml:id="JG.84"/>self, neither gazed at it, smelt it, nor
                    stroked it, according to the custom of his countrymen, when they seek to fill up the pauses in
                    conversation. He was not dressed with the usual magnificence of dignitaries of his degree,
                    except that his high turban, composed of many small rolls, was of golden muslin, and his
                    ataghan studded with diamonds. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap12-5"> He was civil and urbane in the entertainment of his guests, and requested
                    them to consider themselves as his children. It was on this occasion he told <persName
                        key="LdByron">Lord Byron</persName>, that he discovered his noble blood by the smallness of
                    his hands and ears: a remark which has become proverbial, and is acknowledged not to be without
                    truth in the evidence of pedigree. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap12-6"> The ceremonies on such visits are similar all over Turkey, among personages
                    of the same rank; and as <persName key="LdByron">Lord Byron</persName> has not described in
                    verse the details of what took place with him, it will not be altogether obtrusive here to
                    recapitulate what happened to myself during a visit to <persName key="VePasha1822">Velhi
                        Pashaw</persName>, the son of <persName key="AliPasha">Ali</persName>: he was then Vizier
                    of the Morea, and residing at Tripolizza. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap12-7"> In the afternoon, about four o&#8217;clock, I set out for the seraglio with
                        <persName key="DrTeria1809">Dr. Teriano</persName>, the vizier&#8217;s physician, and the
                    vizier&#8217;s Italian secretary. The gate of the palace was not unlike the entrance to some of
                    the closes in Edinburgh, and the court within reminded me of Smithfield, in London; but it was
                    not surrounded by such lofty buildings, nor in any degree of comparison so well constructed. We
                    ascended a ruinous staircase, which led to an open gallery, where three or four hundred of the
                    vizier&#8217;s Albanian guards were lounging. In an antechamber, which opened from the gallery,
                    a number of officers were smoking, and in the middle, on the floor, two old Turks were
                    seriously engaged at chess. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap12-8"> My name being sent in to the vizier, a guard of ceremony was called, and
                    after they had arranged themselves in the presence chamber, I was admitted. <pb xml:id="JG.85"
                    /> The doctor and the secretary having, in the meantime, taken off their shoes, accompanied me
                    in to act as interpreters. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap12-9"> The presence chamber was about forty feet square, showy and handsome: round
                    the walls were placed sofas, which, from being covered with scarlet, reminded me of the
                    woolsacks in the House of Lords. In the farthest corner of the room, elevated on a crimson
                    velvet cushion, sat the vizier, wrapped in a superb pelisse: on his head was a vast turban, in
                    his belt a dagger, incrusted with jewels, and on the little finger of his right hand he wore a
                    solitaire as large as the knob on the stopper of a vinegar-cruet, and which was said to have
                    cost two thousand five hundred pounds sterling. In his left hand he held a string of small
                    coral beads, a comboloio which he twisted backwards and forwards during the greater part of the
                    visit. On the sofa beside him lay a pair of richly-ornamented London-made pistols. At some
                    distance, on the same sofa, but not on a cushion, sat <persName>Memet</persName>, the Pashaw of
                    Napoli Romania, whose son was contracted in marriage to the vizier&#8217;s daughter. On the
                    floor, at the foot of this pasha, and opposite to the vizier, a secretary was writing
                    despatches. These were the only persons in the room who had the honour of being seated; for,
                    according to the etiquette of this viceregal court, those who received the vizier&#8217;s pay
                    were not allowed to sit down in his presence. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap12-10"> On my entrance, his highness motioned to me to sit beside him, and through
                    the medium of the interpreters began with some commonplace courtly insignificancies, as a
                    prelude to more interesting conversation. In his manners I found him free and affable, with a
                    considerable tincture of humour and drollery. Among other questions, he inquired if I had a
                    wife: and being answered in the negative, he replied to me himself in Italian, that I was a
                    happy man, for he found his very troublesome: considering their pro-<pb xml:id="JG.86"/>bable
                    number, this was not unlikely. Pipes and coffee were in the mean-time served. The pipe
                    presented to the vizier was at least twelve feet long; the mouth-piece was formed of a single
                    block of amber, about the size of an ordinary cucumber, and fastened to the shaft by a broad
                    hoop of gold, decorated with jewels. While the pipes and coffee were distributing, a musical
                    clock, which stood in a niche, began to play, and continued doing so until this ceremony was
                    over. The coffee was literally a drop of dregs in a very small china cup, placed in a golden
                    socket. His highness was served with his coffee by <persName>Pashaw Bey</persName>, his
                    generalissimo, a giant, with the tall crown of a dun-coloured beaver-hat on his head. In
                    returning the cup to him, the vizier elegantly eructated in his face. After the regale of the
                    pipes and coffee, the attendants withdrew, and his highness began a kind of political
                    discussion, in which, though making use of an interpreter, he managed to convey his questions
                    with delicacy and address. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap12-11"> On my rising to retire, his highness informed me, with more polite
                    condescension than a Christian of a thousandth part of his authority would have done, that
                    during my stay at Tripolizza horses were at my command, and guards who would accompany me to
                    any part of the country I might choose to visit. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap12-12"> Next morning, he sent a complimentary message, importing, that he had
                    ordered dinner to be prepared at the doctor&#8217;s for me and two of his officers. The two
                    officers were lively fellows; one of them in particular seemed to have acquired, by instinct, a
                    large share of the ease and politeness of Christendom. The dinner surpassed all count and
                    reckoning, dish followed dish, till I began to fancy that the cook either expected I would
                    honour his highness&#8217;s entertainment as <persName key="JuCaesa">C&#230;sar</persName> did
                    the supper of <persName key="MaCicer">Cicero</persName>, or supposed that the party were not
                    finite beings. During the course of this amazing service, the principal singers and musicians
                    of the seraglio <pb xml:id="JG.87"/> arrived, and sung and played several pieces of very sweet
                    Turkish music. Among others was a song composed by the late unfortunate <persName key="Selim3"
                        >sultan Selim</persName>, the air of which was pleasingly simple and pathetic. I had heard
                    of the sultan&#8217;s poetry before, a small collection of which has been printed. It is said
                    to be interesting and tender, consisting chiefly of little sonnets, written after he was
                    deposed; in which he contrasts the tranquillity of his retirement with the perils and anxieties
                    of his former grandeur. After the songs, the servants of the officers, who were Albanians,
                    danced a Macedonian reel, in which they exhibited several furious specimens of Highland
                    agility. The officers then took their leave, and I went to bed, equally gratified by the
                    hospitality of the vizier and the incidents of the entertainment. </p>

                    he drew several of their most remarkable features; and on this account it may be expedient to

                    defect, according to the plan of this work, not to do so. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap13-2">
                    <persName key="AliPasha">Ali Pashaw</persName> was born at Tepellen&#233;, about the year 1750.
                    His father was a pasha of two tails, but possessed of little influence. At his death
                        <persName>Ali</persName> succeeded to no inheritance but the house in which he was born;
                    and it was his boast, in the plenitude of his power, that he began his fortune with sixty
                    paras, about eighteen pence sterling, and a musket. At that time the country was much infested
                    with cattle-stealers, and the flocks and herds of the neighbouring villages were often
                    plundered. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap13-3">
                    <persName key="AliPasha">Ali</persName> collected a few followers from among the retainers of
                    his father, made himself master, first of one village, then of another, amassed money,
                    increased his power, and at last found himself at the head of a considerable body of Albanians,
                    whom he paid by plunder; for he was then only a great robber&#8212;the <pb xml:id="JG.89"/>
                    <persName type="fiction">Rob Roy</persName> of Albania: in a word, one of those independent
                    freebooters who divide among themselves so much of the riches and revenues of the Ottoman
                    dominions. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap13-4"> In following up this career, he met with many adventures and reverses, but
                    his course was still onwards, and uniformly distinguished by enterprise and cruelty. His
                    enemies expected no mercy when vanquished in the field; and when accidentally seized in
                    private, they were treated with equal rigour. It is reported that he even roasted alive on
                    spits some of his most distinguished adversaries. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap13-5"> When he had collected money enough, he bought a pashalic; and being invested
                    with that dignity, he became still more eager to enlarge his possessions. He continued in
                    constant war with the neighbouring pashas; and cultivating, by adroit agents, the most
                    influential interest at Constantinople, he finally obtained possession of Joannina, and was
                    confirmed pasha of the territory attached to it, by an imperial firman. He then went to war
                    with the pashas of Arta, of Delvino, and of Ocrida, whom he subdued, together with that of
                    Triccala, and established a predominant influence over the agas of Thessaly. The pasha of
                    Vallona he poisoned in a bath at Sophia; and strengthened his power by marrying his two sons,
                        <persName>Mouctar</persName> and <persName key="VePasha1822">Velhi</persName>, to the
                    daughters of the successor and brother of the man whom he had murdered. In <name type="title"

                <p xml:id="chap13-6"> During this progression of his fortunes, he had been more than once called
                    upon to furnish his quota of <pb xml:id="JG.90"/> troops to the imperial armies, and had served
                    at their head with distinction against the Russians. He knew his countrymen, however, too well
                    ever to trust himself at Constantinople. It was reported that he had frequently been offered
                    some of the highest offices in the empire, but he always declined them and sought for power
                    only among the fastnesses of his native region. Stories of the skill and courage with which he
                    counteracted several machinations to procure his head were current and popular throughout the
                    country, and among the Greeks in general he was certainly regarded as inferior only to the
                    grand vizier himself. But though distrusting and distrusted, he always in the field fought for
                    the sultan with great bravery, particularly against the famous rebel <persName>Paswan
                        Oglou</persName>. On his return from that war in 1798, he was, in consequence, made a pasha
                    of three tails, or vizier, and was more than once offered the ultimate dignity of grand vizier,
                    but he still declined all the honours of the metropolis. The object of his ambition was not
                    temporary power, but to found a kingdom. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap13-7"> He procured, however, pashalics for his two sons, the younger of whom,
                        <persName key="VePasha1822">Velhi</persName>, saved sufficient money in his first
                    government to buy the pashalic of the Morea, with the dignity of vizier, for which he paid
                    seventy-five thousand pounds sterling. His eldest son, <persName>Mouctar</persName>, was of a
                    more warlike turn, with less ambition than his brother. At the epoch of which I am speaking, he
                    supplied his father&#8217;s place at the head of the Albanians in the armies of the sultan, in
                    which he greatly distinguished himself in the campaign of 1809 against the Russians. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap13-8"> The difficulties which <persName key="AliPasha">Ali Pashaw</persName> had to
                    encounter in establishing his ascendancy, did not arise so much from the opposition he met with
                    from the neighbouring pashas as from the nature of the people, and of the country of which he
                    was determined to make himself master. Many of the plains and valleys which com-<pb
                        xml:id="JG.91"/>posed his dominions were occupied by inhabitants who had been always in
                    rebellion, and were never entirely conquered by the Turks, such as the Chimeriotes, the
                    Sulliotes, and the nations living among the mountains adjacent to the coast of the Ionian Sea.
                    Besides this, the woods and hills of every part of his dominions were in a great degree
                    possessed by formidable bands of robbers, who, recruited and protected by the villages, and
                    commanded by chiefs as brave and as enterprising as himself, laid extensive tracts under
                    contribution, burning and plundering regardless of his jurisdiction. Against these he proceeded
                    with the most iron severity; they were burned, hanged, beheaded, and impaled, in all parts of
                    the country, until they were either exterminated or expelled. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap13-9"> A short time before the arrival of <persName key="LdByron">Lord
                        Byron</persName> at Joannina, a large body of insurgents who infested the mountains between
                    that city and Triccala, were defeated and dispersed by <persName>Mouctar Pashaw</persName>, who
                    cut to pieces a hundred of them on the spot. These robbers had been headed by a Greek priest,
                    who, after the defeat, went to Constantinople and procured a firman of protection, with which
                    he ventured to return to Joannina, where the vizier invited him to a conference, and made him a
                    prisoner. In deference to the firman, <persName key="AliPasha">Ali</persName> confined him in
                    prison, but used him well until a messenger could bring from Constantinople a permission from
                    the Porte to authorise him to do what he pleased with the rebel. It was the arm of this man
                    which <persName>Byron</persName> beheld suspended from the bough on entering Joannina. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap13-10"> By these vigorous measures, <persName key="AliPasha">Ali Pashaw</persName>
                    rendered the greater part of Albania and the contiguous districts safely accessible, which were
                    before overrun by bandits and freebooters; and consequently, by opening the country to
                    merchants, and securing their persons and goods, not only increased his own revenues, but
                        im-<pb xml:id="JG.92"/>proved the condition of his subjects. He built bridges over the
                    rivers, raised causeways over the marshes, opened roads, adorned the country and the towns with
                    new buildings, and by many salutary regulations, acted the part of a just, though a merciless,
                    prince. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap13-11"> In private life he was no less distinguished for the same unmitigated
                    cruelty, but he afforded many examples of strong affection. The wife of his son
                        <persName>Mouctar</persName> was a great favourite with the old man. Upon paying her a
                    visit one morning, he found her in tears. He questioned her several times as to the cause of
                    her grief; she at last reluctantly acknowledged that it arose from the diminution of her
                    husband&#8217;s regard. He inquired if she thought he paid attention to other women; the reply
                    was in the affirmative; and she related that a lady of the name of
                        <persName>Phrosyne</persName>, the wife of a rich Jew, had beguiled her of her
                    husband&#8217;s love; for she had seen at the bath, upon the finger of
                        <persName>Phrosyne</persName>, a rich ring, which had belonged to
                        <persName>Mouctar</persName>, and which she had often in vain entreated him to give to her.
                        <persName key="AliPasha">Ali</persName> immediately ordered the lady to be seized, and to
                    be tied up in a sack, and cast into the lake. Various versions of this tragical tale are met
                    with in all parts of the country, and the fate of <persName>Phrosyne</persName> is embodied in
                    a ballad of touching pathos and melody. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap13-12"> That the character of this intrepid and ruthless warrior made a deep
                    impression on the mind of <persName key="LdByron">Byron</persName> cannot be questioned. The
                    scenes in which he acted were, as the poet traversed the country, everywhere around him; and
                    his achievements, bloody, dark, and brave, had become themes of song and admiration. </p>

                    they bade it adieu, and returned to Salona, on the Golf of Arta; where, in consequence of
                    hearing that the inhabitants of Carnia were up in arms, that numerous bands of robbers had
                    descended from the mountains of Ziccola and Agrapha, and had made their appearance on the other

                        key="LdByron">Lord Byron</persName> says they reminded him strongly of the Highlanders of
                    Scotland, whom they undoubtedly resemble in dress, figure, and manner of living. <q>&#8220;The
                        very mountains seemed Caledonian with a kinder climate. The kilt, though white, the spare
                        active form, their dialect, Celtic in its sound, and their hardy habits, all carried me
                        back to Morven. No nation are so detested and dreaded by their neighbours as the Albanese;
                        the Greeks hardly regard them as Christians, or the Turks as Moslems, and in fact they are
                        a mixture of both, and sometimes neither. Their habits are predatory: all are armed, and
                        the red-shawled Arnaouts, the Montenegrins, Chimeriotes, and Gedges, are treacherous; the
                        others differ somewhat in garb, and essentially in character. As far as my own experience
                        goes, I can speak favourably. I was attended by two, an infidel and a Mussulman, to
                        Constantinople and every other part of Turkey which came within my observations, and more
                        faithful in peril and indefatigable in service are nowhere to be found. The infidel was
                        named <persName>Basilius</persName>, the Moslem <persName key="DeTahir1815">Dervish
                            Tahiri</persName>; the former a man of middle age, and the latter about my own.
                            <persName>Basili</persName> was strictly charged by <persName key="AliPasha">Ali

                        and onward to <pb xml:id="JG.95"/> Missolonghi. There I took him into my own service, and

                        within a given time. To this consolatory assurance of posthumous retribution, and a

                        Stamboul, because it had once been a place of his worship. On remonstrating with him on his

                        necessary where a priest had any influence with the Cogia Bashi of his village. Indeed, a

                    clasping his hands, which he raised to his forehead, rushed out of the room weeping bitterly.
                    From that moment to the hour of my embarkation, he continued his lamentations, and all our

                        countenance; and the most beautiful women I have ever beheld, in stature and in features,
                        we saw levelling the road broken down by the torrents between Delvinaki and Libokavo. Their
                        manner of walking is truly theatrical, but this strut is probably the effect of the capote
                        or cloak depending from one shoulder. Their long hair reminds you of the Spartans, and
                        their courage in desultory warfare is unquestionable. Though <pb xml:id="JG.97"/> they have
                        some cavalry among the Gedges, I never saw a good Arnaout horseman, but on foot they are

                    revisited. </p>

                    Carnia, and the country being, as already mentioned, overrun with robbers, they provided
                    themselves with a guard of thirty-seven soldiers, and procured another galliot to take them
                    down the Gulf of Arta, to the place whence they were to commence their land journey. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap14-11"> Having embarked, they continued sailing with very little wind until they
                    reached the fortress of Vonitza, where they waited all night for the freshening of the morning
                    breeze, with which they again set sail, and about four o&#8217;clock in the afternoon arrived
                    at Utraikee. </p>

                    and roasted whole, and four fires were kindled in the yard, around which the soldiers seated
                    themselves in parties. After eating and drinking, the greater part of them assembled at the
                    largest of the fires, and, while the travellers were themselves with the elders of the party
                    seated on the ground, danced round the blaze to their own songs, with astonishing Highland

                        >Byron</persName> and his friend continued their journey southward. The reports of the
                    state of the country induced them to take ten additional soldiers with them, as their road for
                    the first two hours lay through dangerous passes in the forest. On approaching these places
                    fifteen or twenty of the party walked briskly on before, and when they had gone through the
                    pass halted until the travellers came up. In the woods two or three green spots were discovered
                    on the road-side, and on them Turkish tombstones, generally under a clump of trees, and near a
                    well or fountain. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap15-2"> When they had passed the forest they reached an open country, whence they
                    sent back the ten men whom they had brought from Utraikee. They then passed on to a village
                    called Catoona, where they arrived by noon. It was their intention to have proceeded farther
                    that day, but their progress was interrupted by an affair between their Albanian guard and the
                    primate of the village. As they were looking about, while horses were collecting to carry their
                    luggage, one of the soldiers drew his sword at the primate, the Greek head magistrate; guns
                    were cocked, and in an instant, before either <persName key="LdByron">Lord Byron</persName> or
                        <persName key="JoHobho1869">Mr. Hobhouse</persName> could stop the affray, the primate,
                    throwing off his shoes and cloak, fled so precipitately that he rolled <pb xml:id="JG.100"/>
                    down the hill and dislocated his shoulder. It was a long time before they could persuade him to
                    return to his house, where they lodged, and when he did return he remarked that he cared
                    comparatively little about his shoulder to the loss of a purse with fifteen sequins, which had
                    dropped out of his pocket during the tumble. The hint was understood. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap15-3"> Catoona is inhabited by Greeks only, and is a rural, well-built village. The
                    primate&#8217;s house was neatly fitted up with sofas. Upon a knoll, in the middle of the
                    village, stood a schoolhouse, and from that spot the view was very extensive. To the west are
                    lofty mountains, ranging from north to south, near the coast; to the east a grand romantic
                    prospect in the distance, and in the foreground a green valley, with a considerable river
                    winding through a long line of country. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap15-4"> They had some difficulty in procuring horses at Catoona, and in consequence
                    were detained until past eleven o&#8217;clock the next morning, and only travelled four hours
                    that day to Makala, a well-built stone village, containing about forty houses distinct from
                    each other, and inhabited by Greeks, who were a little above the condition of peasants, being
                    engaged in pasturage and a small wool-trade. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap15-5"> The travellers were now in Carnia, where they found the inhabitants much
                    better lodged than in the Albanian villages. The house in which they slept at this place
                    resembled those old mansions which are to be met with in the bottoms of the Wiltshire Downs.
                    Two green courts, one before and the other behind, were attached to it, and the whole was
                    surrounded by a high and thick wall, which shut out the prospect, but was necessary in a
                    country so frequently overrun by strong bands of freebooters. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap15-6"> From Makala they proceeded through the woods, and in the course of their
                    journey passed three new-made graves, which the Albanians pointing at as <pb xml:id="JG.101"/>
                    they rode by, said they were &#8220;robbers.&#8221; In the course of the journey they had a
                    distant view of the large town of Vraikore, on the left bank of the Aspro, but they did not
                    approach it, crossing the river by a ferry to the village of Gouria, where they passed the
                    night. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap15-7"> Leaving that place in the morning, they took an easterly direction, and
                    continued to ride across a plain of cornfields, near the banks of the river, in a rich country;
                    sometimes over stone causeways, and between the hedges of gardens and olive-groves, until they
                    were stopped by the sea. This was that fruitful region formerly called Paracheloitis, which,
                    according to classic allegory, was drained or torn from the river Achelous, by the perseverance
                    of <persName type="fiction">Hercules</persName> and presented by him for a nuptial present to

                <p xml:id="chap15-8"> The water at which they had now arrived was rather a salt marsh than the sea,
                    a shallow bay stretching from the mouth of the Gulf of Lepanto into the land for several miles.
                    Having dismissed their horses, they passed over in boats to Natolico, a town which stood in the
                    water. Here they fell in with a hospitable Jew, who made himself remembered by saying that he
                    was honoured in their having partaken of his little misery. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap15-9"> Natolico, where they stayed for the night, was a well-built town; the houses
                    of timber, chiefly of two stories, and about six hundred in number. Having sent on their
                    baggage in boats, they themselves proceeded to the town of Missolonghi, so celebrated since as
                    having suffered greatly during the recent rebellion of the Greeks, but more particularly as the
                    place where <persName key="LdByron">Lord Byron</persName> died. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap15-10"> Missolonghi is situated on the south side of the salt marsh or shallow,
                    along the north coast of the Gulf of Corinth, nearly opposite to Patras. It is a dull, and I
                    should think an unwholesome place. The marsh, for miles on each side, has only from a foot to
                    two feet of water on it, but there is a channel for boats marked out <pb xml:id="JG.102"/> by
                    perches. When I was there the weather was extremely wet, and I had no other opportunity of
                    seeing the character of the adjacent country than during the intervals of the showers. It was
                    green and pastoral, with a short skirt of cultivation along the bottom of the hills. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap15-11"> Abrupt and rapid as the foregoing sketch of the journey through Albania has
                    been, it is evident from the novelty of its circumstances that it could not be performed
                    without leaving deep impressions on the susceptible mind of the poet. It is impossible, I
                    think, not to allow that far more of the wildness and romantic gloom of his imagination was
                    derived from the incidents of this tour, than from all the previous experience of his life. The
                    scenes he visited, the characters with whom he became familiar, and above all, the chartered
                    feelings, passions, and principles of the inhabitants, were greatly calculated to supply his
                    mind with rare and valuable poetical materials. It is only in this respect that the details of
                    his travels are interesting.&#8212;Considered as constituting a portion of the education of his
                    genius, they are highly curious, and serve to show how little, after all, of great invention is
                    requisite to make interesting and magnificent poetry. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap15-12"> From Missolonghi the travellers passed over the Gulf of Corinth to Patras,
                    then a rude, half-ruined, open town with a fortress on the top of a hill; and on the 4th of
                    December, in the afternoon, they proceeded towards Corinth, but halted at Vostizza, the ancient
                    &#198;gium, where they obtained their first view of Parnassus, on the opposite side of the
                    gulf; rising high above the other peaks of that hilly region, and capped with snow. It probably
                    was during this first visit to Vostizza that the Address to Parnassus was suggested. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap16-1">
                    <hi rend="small-caps">Vostizza</hi> was then a considerable town, containing between three and
                    four thousand inhabitants, chiefly Greeks. It stands on a rising ground on the Peloponnesian
                    side of the Gulf of Corinth. I say stands, but I know not if it has survived the war. The
                    scenery around it will always make it delightful, while the associations connected with the
                    Achaian League, and the important events which have happened in the vicinity, will ever render
                    the site interesting. The battle of Lepanto, in which <persName key="MiCerva"
                        >Cervantes</persName> lost his hand, was fought within sight of it. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap16-2"> What a strange thing is glory! Three hundred years ago all Christendom rang
                    with the battle of Lepanto, and yet it is already probable that it will only be interesting to
                    posterity as an incident in the life of one of the private soldiers engaged in it. This is
                    certainly no very mournful reflection to one who is of opinion that there is no permanent fame,
                    but that which is obtained by adding to the comforts and pleasures of mankind. Military
                    transactions, after their immediate effects cease to be felt, are little productive of such a
                    result. Not that I value military virtues the less by being of this opinion; on the contrary, I
                    am the more convinced of their excellence. <persName key="EdBurke1797">Burke</persName> has
                    unguardedly said, <q>&#8216;that vice loses half its malignity by losing its
                        grossness&#8217;</q>; but public virtue ceases to be useful when it sickens at the <pb
                        xml:id="JG.105"/> calamities of necessary war. The moment that nations become confident of
                    security, they give way to corruption. The evils and dangers of war seem as requisite for the
                    preservation of public morals as the laws themselves; at least it is the melancholy moral of
                    history, that when nations resolve to be peaceful with respect to their neighbours, they begin
                    to be vicious with respect to themselves. But to return to the travellers. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap16-3"> On the 14th of December they hired a boat with fourteen men and ten oars, and
                    sailed to Salona; thence they proceeded to Crisso, and rode on to Delphi, ascending the
                    mountain on horseback, by a steep, craggy path towards the north-east. After scaling the side
                    of Parnassus for about an hour, they saw vast masses of rock, and fragments of stone, piled in
                    a perilous manner above them, with niches and sepulchres, and relics, and remains on all sides. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap16-4"> They visited and drank of Castalia, and the prophetic font, Cassotis; but
                    still, like every other traveller, they were disappointed. Parnassus is an emblem of the
                    fortune that attends the votaries of the Muses, harsh, rugged, and barren. The woods that once
                    waved on Delphi&#8217;s steep have all passed away, and may now be sought in vain. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap16-5"> A few traces of terraces may yet be discovered&#8212;here and there the stump
                    of a column, while niches for receiving votive offerings are numerous among the cliffs, but it
                    is a lone and dismal place; Desolation sits with Silence, and Ruin there is so decayed as to be
                    almost Oblivion. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap16-6"> Parnassus is not so much a single mountain as the loftiest of a range; the
                    cloven summit appears most conspicuous when seen from the south. The northern view is, however,
                    more remarkable, for the cleft is less distinguishable, and seven lower peaks suggest, in
                    contemplation with the summits, the fancy of so many seats of the Muses. These peaks, nine in
                    all, are the <pb xml:id="JG.106"/> first of the hills which receive the rising sun, and the
                    last that in the evening part with his light. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap16-7"> From Delphi the travellers proceeded towards Livadia, passing in the course
                    of the journey the confluence of the three roads where <persName type="fiction"
                        >&#338;dipus</persName> slew his father, an event with its hideous train of fatalities
                    which could not be recollected by <persName key="LdByron">Byron</persName> on the spot, even
                    after the tales of guilt he had gathered in his Albanian journeys, without agitating
                    associations. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap16-8"> At Livadia they remained the greater part of three days, during which they
                    examined with more than ordinary minuteness the cave of Trophonius, and the streams of the
                    Hercyna, composed of the mingled waters of the two fountains of Oblivion and Memory. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap16-9"> From Livadia, after visiting the battlefield of Ch&#230;ron&#233;a (the
                    birthplace of <persName key="Pluta120">Plutarch</persName>), and also many of the almost
                    innumerable storied and consecrated spots in the neighbourhood, the travellers proceeded to
                    Thebes&#8212;a poor town, containing about five hundred wooden houses, with two shabby mosques
                    and four humble churches. The only thing worthy of notice in it is a public clock, to which the
                    inhabitants direct the attention of strangers as proudly as if it were indeed one of the
                    wonders of the world. There they still affect to show the fountain of Dirce and the ruins of
                    the house of <persName key="Pindar438">Pindar</persName>. But it is unnecessary to describe the
                    numberless relics of the famous things of Greece, which every hour, as they approached towards
                    Athens, lay more and more in their way. Not that many remarkable objects met their view; yet
                    fragments of antiquity were often seen, though many of them were probably brought far from the
                    edifices to which they had originally belonged; not for their beauty, or on account of the
                    veneration which the sight of them inspired, but because they would burn into better lime than
                    the coarser rock of the hills. Nevertheless, abased and returned into rudeness as all things
                    were, the presence of Greece was felt, <pb xml:id="JG.107"/> and <persName key="LdByron"

                    so much on account of their magnificence as of their exquisite beauty, that the fragments

                    able to ascertain; while I am inclined to think it was so, as I recollect he told me there that
                    he had then described or was describing the reception he had met with at Tepellen&#233; from

                <p xml:id="chap17-7"> After having halted some time at Athens, where they established their
                    headquarters, the travellers, when they had inspected the principal antiquities of the city
                    (those things which all travellers must visit), made several excursions into the environs, and
                    among other places went to Eleusis. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap17-8"> On the 13th of January they mounted earlier than usual, and set out on that
                    road which has the site of the Academy and the Colonos, the retreat of <persName type="fiction"
                        >&#338;dipus</persName> during his banishment, a little to the right; they then entered the
                    Olive Groves, crossed the Cephessus, and came to an open, well-cultivated plain, extending on
                    the left to the Piraeus and the sea. Having ascended by a gentle acclivity through a pass, at
                    the distance of eight or ten miles from Athens, the ancient Corydallus, now called
                    Daphn&#233;-rouni, they came, at the bottom of a piny mountain, to the little monastery of
                    Daphn&#233;, the appearance and situation of which are in agreeable unison. The monastery was
                    then fast verging into that state of the uninhabitable picturesque so much admired by young
                    damsels and artists of a romantic vein. The pines on the adjacent mountains hiss as they <pb
                        xml:id="JG.112"/> ever wave their boughs, and somehow, such is the lonely aspect of the
                    place, that their hissing may be imagined to breathe satire against the pretensions of human
                    vanity. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap17-9"> After passing through the hollow valley in which this monastic habitation is
                    situated, the road sharply turns round an elbow of the mountain, and the Eleusinian plain opens
                    immediately in front. It is, however, for a plain, but of small dimensions. On the left is the
                    Island of Salamis, and the straits where the battle was fought; but neither of it nor of the
                    mysteries for which the Temple of <persName type="fiction">Ceres</persName> was for so many
                    ages celebrated, has the poet given us description or suggestion; and yet few topics among all
                    his wild and wonderful subjects were so likely to have furnished such &#8220;ample room, and
                    verge enough&#8221; to his fancy. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap17-10"> The next excursion in any degree interesting, it a qualification of that
                    kind can be applied to excursions, in Attica, was to Cape Colonna. Crossing the bed of the
                    Ilissus and keeping nearer to Mount Hymettus, the travellers arrived at Vary, a farm belonging
                    to the monastery of Agios Asomatos, and under the charge of a caloyer. Here they stopped for
                    the night, and being furnished with lights, and attended by the caloyer&#8217;s servant as a
                    guide, they proceeded to inspect the Paneum, or sculptured cavern in that neighbourhood, into
                    which they descended. Having satisfied their curiosity there, they proceeded, in the morning,
                    to Kerat&#233;a, a small town containing about two hundred and fifty houses, chiefly inhabited
                    by rural Albanians. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap17-11"> The wetness of the weather obliged them to remain several days at
                    Kerat&#233;a, during which they took the opportunity of a few hours of sunshine to ascend the
                    mountain of Parn&#233; in quest of a cave of which many wonderful things were reported in the
                    country. Having found the entrance, kindled their pine torches, and taken a supply of strips of
                    the same wood, they let <pb xml:id="JG.113"/> themselves down through a narrow aperture;
                    creeping still farther down, they came into what seemed a large subterranean hall, arched as it
                    were with high cupolas of crystal, and divided into long aisles by columns of glittering spar,
                    in some parts spread into wide horizontal chambers, in others terminated by the dark mouths of
                    deep and steep abysses receding into the interior of the mountain. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap17-12"> The travellers wandered from one grotto to another until they came to a
                    fountain of pure water, by the side of which they lingered some time, till, observing that
                    their torches were wasting, they resolved to return; but after exploring the labyrinth for a
                    few minutes, they found themselves again close beside this mysterious spring. It was not
                    without reason they then became alarmed, for the guide confessed with trepidation that he had
                    forgotten the intricacies of the cave, and knew not how to recover the outlet. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap17-13">
                    <persName key="LdByron">Byron</persName> often described this adventure with spirit and humour,
                    magnifying both his own and his friend&#8217;s terrors; and though, of course, there was
                    caricature in both, yet the distinction was characteristic. <persName key="JoHobho1869">Mr.
                        Hobhouse</persName>, being of a more solid disposition naturally, could discern nothing but
                    a grave cause for dread in being thus lost in the bowels of the earth;
                        <persName>Byron</persName>, however, described his own anxiety as a species of excitement
                    and titillation which moved him to laughter. Their escape from starvation and being buried
                    alive was truly providential. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap17-14"> While roaming in a state of despair from cave to cell; climbing up narrow
                    apertures; their last pine-torch fast consuming; totally ignorant of their position, and all
                    around darkness, they discovered, as it were by accident, a ray of light gleaming towards them;
                    they hastened towards it, and arrived at the mouth of the cave. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap17-15"> Although the poet has not made any use of this incident in description, the
                    actual experience which it gave <pb xml:id="JG.114"/> him of what despair is, could not but
                    enrich his metaphysical store, and increase his knowledge of terrible feelings; of the workings
                    of the darkest and dreadest anticipations&#8212;slow famishing death&#8212;cannibalism and the

                        We all arrived at Colonna, remained some hours, and returned leisurely, saying a variety of

                    situated; which, according to <persName key="GeWhele1724">Sir George Wheler</persName>, were
                    worked with some success about a hundred and fifty years ago. They then set out for Marathon,
                    taking Rapthi in their way; where, in the lesser port, on a steep rocky island, they beheld,
                    from a distance, the remains of a colossal statue. They did not, however, actually inspect it,
                    but it has been visited by other travellers, who have described it to be of white marble,
                    sedent on a pedestal. The head and arms are broken off; but when entire, it is conjectured to
                    have been twelve feet in height. As they were passing round the shore they heard the barking of
                    dogs, and a shout from a shepherd, and on looking round saw a large dun-coloured wolf,
                    galloping slowly through the bushes. </p>

                    danger, were full of poetry, and undoubtedly contributed to the formation of the peculiar taste
                    of <persName key="LdByron">Byron&#8217;s</persName> genius. As it has been said of <persName

                        <persName>Byron</persName>, that much of his most distinguished power was the result of his
                    adventures as a traveller in Greece. His mind and memory were filled with stores of the fittest
                    imagery, to supply becoming backgrounds and appendages, to the characters and enterprises which
                    he afterward depicted with such truth of nature and poetical effect. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap18-9"> After leaving Rapthi, keeping Mount Pentilicus on the left, the travellers
                    came in sight of the ever-celebrated Plain of Marathon. The evening being advanced, they passed
                    the barrow of the Athenian slain unnoticed, but next morning they examined minutely the field
                    of battle, and fancied they had made antiquarian discoveries. In their return to Athens they
                    inspected the different objects of research and fragments of antiquity, which still attract
                    travellers, and with the help of <persName key="RiChand1810">Chandler</persName> and <persName

                    Negropont, where he was absent some few days. I think he had only been back three or four when
                    I arrived from Zante. My visit to Athens at that period was accidental. I had left Malta with
                    the intention of proceeding to Candia, by Specia, and Idra; but a dreadful storm drove us up
                    the Adriatic, as far as Valona; and in returning, being becalmed off the Island of Zante, I
                    landed there, and allowed the ship, with my luggage, to proceed to her destination, having been
                    advised to go on by the Gulf of Corinth <pb xml:id="JG.119"/> to Athens; from which place, I
                    was informed, there would be no difficulty in recovering my trunks. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap18-11"> In carrying this arrangement into effect, I was induced to go aside from the
                    direct route, and to visit <persName key="VePasha1822">Velhi Pashaw</persName>, at Tripolizza,
                    to whom I had letters. Returning by Argos and Corinth, I crossed the isthmus, and taking the
                    road by Megara, reached Athens on the 20th of February. In the course of this journey, I heard
                    of two English travellers being in the city; and on reaching the convent of the Propaganda,
                    where I had been advised to take up my lodgings, the friar in charge of the house informed me
                    of their names. Next morning, <persName key="JoHobho1869">Mr. Hobhouse</persName>, having heard
                    of my arrival, kindly called on me, and I accompanied him to <persName key="LdByron">Lord

                    a Greek, who had been British Consul. She was, I believe, a respectable person, with several

                    his Lordship&#8217;s verses than her degree of beauty deserved. She was a pale and
                    pensive-looking girl, with regular Grecian features. Whether he really cherished any sincere
                    attachment to her I much doubt. I believe his passion was equally innocent and poetical, though
                    he spoke of buying her from her mother. It was to this damsel that he addressed the stanzas

                    <hi rend="small-caps">During</hi> his residence at Athens, <persName key="LdByron">Lord
                        Byron</persName> made almost daily excursions on horseback, chiefly for exercise and to see
                    the localities of celebrated spots. He affected to have no taste for the arts, and he certainly
                    took but little pleasure in the examination of the ruins. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap19-2"> The marble quarry of Mount Pentilicus, from which the materials for the
                    temples and principal edifices of Athens are supposed to have been brought, was, in those days,
                    one of the regular staple curiosities of Greece. This quarry is a vast excavation in the side
                    of the hill; a drapery of woodbine hangs like the festoons of a curtain over the entrance; the
                    effect of which, seen from the outside, is really worth looking at, but not worth the trouble
                    of riding three hours over a road of rude and rough fragments to see: the interior is like that
                    of any other cavern. To this place I one day was induced to accompany the two travellers. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap19-3"> We halted at a monastery close by the foot of the mountain, where we procured
                    a guide, and ate a repast of olives and fried eggs. <persName key="RiChand1810">Dr.
                        Chandler</persName> says that the monks, or caloyers, of this convent are summoned to
                    prayers by a tune which is played on a piece of an iron hoop; and, on the outside of the
                    church, we certainly saw a piece of crooked iron suspended. When struck, it uttered a bell-like
                    sound, by which the hour of <pb xml:id="JG.121"/> prayer was announced. What sort of tune could
                    be played on such an instrument the doctor has judiciously left his readers to imagine. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap19-4"> When we reached the mouth of the grotto, by that <q>&#8220;very bad
                        track&#8221;</q> which the learned personage above mentioned clambered up, we saw the ruins
                    of the building which the doctor at first thought had been possibly a hermit&#8217;s cell; but
                    which, upon more deliberate reflection, he became of opinion <q>&#8220;was designed, perhaps,
                        for a sentinel to look out, and regulate, by signals, the approach of the men and teams
                        employed in carrying marble to the city.&#8221;</q> This, we agreed, was a very sagacious
                    conjecture. It was, indeed, highly probable that sentinels were appointed to regulate, by
                    signals, the manoeuvres of carts coming to fetch away stones. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap19-5"> Having looked at the outside of the quarry, and the guide having lighted
                    candles, we entered into the interior, and beheld on all sides what <persName key="RiChand1810"
                        >Dr. Chandler</persName> saw, <q>&#8220;chippings of marble.&#8221;</q> We then descended,
                    consecutively, into a hole, just wide enough to let a man pass; and when we had descended far
                    enough, we found ourselves in a cell, or cave; it might be some ten or twelve feet square. Here
                    we stopped, and, like many others who had been there before us, attempted to engrave our names.
                    Mine was without success; <persName key="LdByron">Lord Byron&#8217;s</persName> was not much
                    better; but <persName key="JoHobho1869">Mr. Hobhouse</persName> was making some progress to
                    immortality, when the blade of his knife snapped, or shutting suddenly, cut his finger. These
                    attempts having failed, we inscribed our initials on the ceiling with the smoke of our candles.
                    After accomplishing this notable feat, we got as well out of the scrape as we could, and
                    returned to Athens by the village of Callandris. In the evening, after dinner, as there
                    happened to be a contract of marriage performing in the neighbourhood, we went to see the
                    ceremony. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap19-6"> Between the contract and espousal two years are <pb xml:id="JG.122"/>
                    generally permitted to elapse among the Greeks in the course of which the bride, according to
                    the circumstances of her relations, prepares domestic chattels for her future family. The
                    affections are rarely consulted on either side, for the mother of the bridegroom commonly
                    arranges the match for her son. In this case, the choice had been evidently made according to
                    the principle on which <persName type="fiction">Mrs. Primrose</persName> chose her wedding
                    gown; viz. for the qualities that would wear well. For the bride was a stout household quean;
                    her face painted with vermilion, and her person arrayed in uncouth embroidered garments.
                    Unfortunately, we were disappointed of seeing the ceremony, as it was over before we arrived. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap19-7"> This incident led me to inquire particularly into the existing usages and
                    customs of the Athenians; and I find in the notes of my journal of the evening of that
                    day&#8217;s adventures, a memorandum of a curious practice among the Athenian maidens when they
                    become anxious to get husbands. On the first evening of the new moon, they put a little honey,
                    a little salt, and a piece of bread on a plate, which they leave at a particular spot on the
                    east bank of the Ilissus, near the Stadium, and muttering some ancient words, to the effect
                    that Fate may send them a handsome young man, return home, and long for the fulfilment of the
                    charm. On mentioning this circumstance to the travellers, one of them informed me, that above
                    the spot where these offerings are made, a statue of <persName type="fiction">Venus</persName>,
                    according to <persName key="Pausa160">Pausanias</persName>, formerly stood. It is, therefore,
                    highly probable that what is now a superstitious, was anciently a religious rite. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap19-8"> At this period my fellow-passengers were full of their adventures in Albania.
                    The country was new, and the inhabitants had appeared to them a bold and singular race. In
                    addition to the characteristic descriptions which I have extracted from <persName key="LdByron"
                        >Lord Byron&#8217;s</persName> notes, as well as <persName key="JoHobho1869">Mr.
                        Hobhouse&#8217;s</persName> travels, I am in-<pb xml:id="JG.123"/>debted to them, as well
                    as to others, for a number of memoranda obtained in conversation, which they have themselves
                    neglected to record, but which probably became unconsciously mingled with the recollections of
                    both; at least, I can discern traces of them in different parts of the poet&#8217;s works. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap19-9"> The Albanians are a race of mountaineers, and it has been often remarked that
                    mountaineers, more than any other people, are attached to their native land, while no other
                    have so strong a thirst of adventure. The affection which they cherish for the scenes of their
                    youth tends, perhaps, to excite their migratory spirit. For the motive of their adventures is
                    to procure the means of subsisting in ease at home. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap19-10"> This migratory humour is not, however, universal to the Albanians, but
                    applies only to those who go in quest of rural employment, and who are found in a state of
                    servitude among even the Greeks. It deserves, however, to be noticed, that with the Greeks they
                    rarely ever mix or intermarry, and that they retain both their own national dress and manners
                    unchanged among them. Several of their customs are singular. It is, for example, in vain to ask
                    a light or any fire from the houses of the Albanians after sunset, if the husband or head of
                    the family be still afield; a custom in which there is more of police regulation than of
                    superstition, as it interdicts a plausible pretext for entering the cottages in the obscurity
                    of twilight, when the women are defenceless by the absence of the men. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap19-11"> Some of their usages, with respect to births, baptisms, and burials, are
                    also curious. When the mother feels the fulness of time at hand, the priestess of <persName
                        type="fiction">Lucina</persName>, the midwife, is duly summoned, and she comes bearing in
                    her hand a tripod, better known as a three-legged stool, the uses of which are only revealed to
                    the initiated. She is received by the matronly friends of the mother, and begins the mysteries
                    by <pb xml:id="JG.124"/> opening every lock and lid in the house. During this ceremony the
                    maiden females are excluded. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap19-12"> The rites which succeed the baptism of a child are still more recondite.
                    Four or five days after the christening, the midwife prepares, with her own mystical hands,
                    certain savoury messes, spreads a table, and places them on it. She then departs, and all the
                    family, leaving the door open, in silence retire to sleep. This table is covered for the Miri
                    of the child, an occult being, that is supposed to have the care of its destiny. In the course
                    of the night, if the child is to be fortunate, the Miri comes and partakes of the feast,
                    generally in the shape of a cat; but if the Miri do not come, nor taste of the food, the child
                    is considered to have been doomed to misfortune and misery; and no doubt the treatment it
                    afterwards receives is consonant to its evil predestination. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap19-13"> The Albanians have, like the vulgar of all countries, a species of hearth or
                    household superstitions, distinct from their wild and imperfect religion. They imagine that
                    mankind, after death, become voorthoolakases, and often pay visits to their friends and foes
                    for the same reasons, and in the same way, that our own country ghosts walk abroad; and their
                    visiting hour is, also, midnight. But the collyvillory is another sort of personage. He
                    delights in mischief and pranks, and is, besides, a lewd and foul spirit; and, therefore, very
                    properly detested. He is let loose on the night of the nativity, with licence for twelve nights
                    to plague men&#8217;s wives; at which time some one of the family must keep wakeful vigil all
                    the livelong night, beside a clear and cheerful fire, otherwise this naughty imp would pour
                    such an aqueous stream on the hearth, that fire could never be kindled there again. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap19-14"> The Albanians are also pestered with another species of malignant creatures;
                    men and women whose gifts are followed by misfortunes, whose eyes glimpse evil, and by whose
                    touch the most prosperous affairs <pb xml:id="JG.125"/> are blasted. They work their malicious
                    sorceries in the dark, collect herbs of baleful influence; by the help of which, they strike
                    their enemies with palsy, and cattle with distemper. The males are called <hi rend="italic"
                        >maissi,</hi> and the females <hi rend="italic">maissa</hi>&#8212;witches and warlocks. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap19-15"> Besides these curious superstitious peculiarities, they have among them
                    persons who pretend to know the character of approaching events by hearing sounds which
                    resemble those that shall accompany the actual occurrence. Having, however, given <persName
                        key="LdByron">Lord Byron&#8217;s</persName> account of the adventure of his servant
                        <persName key="DeTahir1815">Dervish</persName>, at Cape Colonna, it is unnecessary to be
                    more particular with the subject here. Indeed, but for the great impression which everything
                    about the Albanians made on the mind of the poet, the insertion of these memoranda would be
                    irrelevant. They will, however, serve to elucidate several allusions, not otherwise very clear,
                    in those poems of which the scenes are laid in Greece; and tend, in some measure, to confirm
                    the correctness of the opinion, that his genius is much more indebted to facts and actual
                    adventures, than to the force of his imagination. Many things regarded in his most original
                    productions, as fancies and invention, may be traced to transactions in which he was himself a
                    spectator or an actor. The impress of experience is vivid upon them all. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap20-1">
                    <hi rend="small-caps">The</hi> genii that preside over famous places have less influence on the
                    imagination than on the memory. The pleasures enjoyed on the spot spring from the reminiscences
                    of reading; and the subsequent enjoyment derived from having visited celebrated scenes, comes
                    again from the remembrance of objects seen there, and the associations connected with them. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap20-2"> A residence at Athens, day after day, is but little more interesting than in
                    a common country town: but afterwards, in reading either of the ancient or of the modern
                    inhabitants, it is surprising to find how much local knowledge the memory had unconsciously
                    acquired on the spot, arising from the variety of objects to which the attention had been
                    directed. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap20-3"> The best of all <persName key="LdByron">Byron&#8217;s</persName> works, the
                    most racy and original, are undoubtedly those which relate to Greece; but it is only travellers
                    who have visited the scenes that can appreciate them properly. In them his peculiar style and
                    faculty are most eminent; in all his other productions, imitation, even mere translation may be
                    often traced, and though, without question, everything he touched became transmuted into
                    something more beautiful and precious, yet he was never so masterly as in describing the
                    scenery of Greece, and Albanian manners. In a general estimate of his works, it may be found
                    that he has produced as fine or finer <pb xml:id="JG.127"/> passages than any in his Grecian
                    poems; but their excellence, either as respects his own, or the productions of others, is
                    comparative. In the Grecian poems he is only truly original; in them the excellence is all his
                    own, and they possess the rare and distinguished quality of being as true to fact and nature,
                    as they are brilliant in poetical expression. <name type="title" key="LdByron.Harold">Childe
                        Harold&#8217;s Pilgrimage</name> is the most faithful descriptive poem which has been
                    written since the <name type="title" key="Homer800.Odyssey">Odyssey</name>; and the occasional
                    scenes introduced into the other poems, when the action is laid in Greece, are equally vivid
                    and glowing. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap20-4"> When I saw him at Athens, the spring was still shrinking in the bud. It was
                    not until he returned from Constantinople in the following autumn, that he saw the climate and
                    country with those delightful aspects which he has delineated with so much felicity in <name
                        type="title" key="LdByron.Giaour">The Giaour</name> and <name type="title"
                        key="LdByron.Corsair">The Corsair</name>. It may, however, be mentioned, that the fine
                    description of a calm sunset, with which the third canto of <name type="title">The
                        Corsair</name> opens, has always reminded me of the evening before his departure from
                    Athens, owing to the circumstance of my having, in the course of the day, visited the spot
                    which probably suggested the scene described. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap20-5"> It was the 4th of March, 1810; the Pylades sloop of war came that morning
                    into the Piraeus, and landed <persName key="FrDarwi1859">Dr. Darwin</persName>, a son of
                        <persName key="ErDarwi1802">the poet</persName>, with his friend, <persName

                        key="GeFergu1867">Captain Ferguson</persName>, her commander, was so kind as to offer the
                    English then in Athens, viz., <persName key="LdByron">Lord Byron</persName>, <persName
                        key="JoHobho1869">Mr. Hobhouse</persName>, and myself, a passage to Smyrna. As I had not
                    received my luggage from Specia, I could not avail myself of the offer, but the other two did:
                    I accompanied <persName>Captain Ferguson</persName>, however, and <persName>Dr.
                        Darwin</persName>, in a walk to the Straits of Salamis; the ship, in the meantime, after
                    landing them, having been moored there. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap20-6"> It was one of those serene and cloudless days of the early spring, when the
                    first indications of leaf and <pb xml:id="JG.128"/> blossom may just be discerned. The islands
                    slept, as it were, on their glassy couch, and a slight dun haze hung upon the mountains, as if
                    they too were drowsy. After an easy walk of about two hours, passing through the olive groves,
                    and along the bottom of the hill on which <persName key="Xerxe465">Xerxes</persName> sat to
                    view the battle, we came opposite to a little cove near the ferry, and made a signal to the
                    ship for a boat. Having gone on board and partaken of some refreshment, the boat then carried
                    us back to the Piraeus, where we landed, about an hour before sundown&#8212;all the wide
                    landscape presenting at the time the calm and genial tranquillity which is almost experienced
                    anew in reading these delicious lines: </p>

                <p xml:id="chap20-9"> At that time <persName key="LdByron">Lord Byron</persName>, if he did pity
                    the condition of the Greeks, evinced very little confidence in the resurrection of the nation,
                    even although symptoms of change and reanimation were here and there perceptible, and could not
                    have escaped his observation. Greece had indeed been so long ruined, that even her desolation
                    was then in a state of decay. The new cycle in her fortunes had certainly not commenced, but it
                    was manifest, by many a sign, that the course of the old was concluding, and that the whole
                    country felt the assuring auguries of undivulged renovation. The influence of that period did
                    not, however, penetrate the bosom of the poet; and when he first quitted Athens, assuredly he
                    cared as little <pb xml:id="JG.130"/> about the destinies of the Greeks, as he did for those of
                    the Portuguese and Spaniards, when he arrived at Gibraltar. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap20-10"> About three weeks or a month after he had left Athens, I went by a
                    circuitous route to Smyrna, where I found him waiting with <persName key="JoHobho1869">Mr.

                    ambassador. He had, in the meantime, visited Ephesus, and acquired some knowledge of the
                    environs of Smyrna; but he appeared to have been less interested by what he had seen there than
                    by the adventures of his Albanian tour. Perhaps I did him injustice, but I thought he was also,
                    in that short space, something changed, and not with improvement. Towards <persName>Mr.
                        Hobhouse</persName>, he seemed less cordial, and was altogether, I should say, having no
                    better phrase to express what I would describe, more of a <persName type="fiction">Captain
                        Grand</persName> than improved in his manners, and more disposed to hold his own opinion
                    than I had ever before observed in him. I was particularly struck with this at dinner, on the
                    day after my arrival. We dined together with a large party at the consul&#8217;s, and he seemed
                    inclined to exact a deference to his dogmas, that was more lordly than philosophical. One of
                    the naval officers present, I think the captain of the <name type="ship">Salsette</name>, felt,
                    as well as others, this overweening, and announced a contrary opinion on some question
                    connected with the politics of the late <persName key="WiPitt1806">Mr. Pitt</persName> with so
                    much firm good sense, that <persName key="LdByron">Lord Byron</persName> was perceptibly
                    rebuked by it, and became reserved, as if he deemed that sullenness enhanced dignity. I never
                    in the whole course of my acquaintance saw him kithe so unfavourably as he did on that
                    occasion. In the course of the evening, however, he condescended to thaw, and before the party
                    broke up, his austerity began to leaf, and hide its thorns under the influence of a relenting
                    temperament. It was, however, too evident&#8212;at least it was so to me&#8212;<pb
                        xml:id="JG.131"/>that without intending wrong, or any offence, the unchecked humour of his
                    temper was, by its caprices, calculated to prevent him from ever gaining that regard to which
                    his talents and freer moods, independently of his rank, ought to have entitled him. Such men
                    become objects of solicitude, but never of esteem. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap20-11"> I was also on this occasion struck with another new phase in his character;
                    he seemed to be actuated by no purpose&#8212;he spoke no more of passing <q>&#8220;beyond
                        Aurora and the Ganges,&#8221;</q> but seemed disposed to let the current of chances carry
                    him as it might. If he had any specific object in view, it was something that made him hesitate
                    between going home and returning to Athens when he should have reached Constantinople, now
                    become the ultimate goal of his intended travels. To what cause this sudden and singular
                    change, both in demeanour and design, was owing, I was on the point of saying, it would be
                    fruitless to conjecture; but a letter to his mother, written a few days before my arrival at
                    Smyrna, throws some light on the sources of his unsatisfied state. He appears by it to have
                    been disappointed of letters and remittances from his agent, and says: </p>

                <p xml:id="chap20-12">
                    <q> &#8220;When I arrive at Constantinople, I shall determine whether to proceed into Persia,
                        or return&#8212;which latter I do not wish if I can avoid it. But I have no intelligence
                        from <persName key="JoHanso1841">Mr. H.</persName>, and but one letter from yourself. I
                        shall stand in need of remittances, whether I proceed or return. I have written to him
                        repeatedly, that he may not plead ignorance of my situation for neglect.&#8221; </q>
                </p>

                <p xml:id="chap20-13"> Here is sufficient evidence that the cause of the undetermined state of his
                    mind, which struck me so forcibly, was owing to the incertitude of his affairs at home; and it
                    is easy to conceive that the false dignity he assumed, and which seemed so like arrogance, was
                    the natural effect of the anxiety and embarrassment he suffered, and of the apprehension of a
                    person of his rank <pb xml:id="JG.132"/> being, on account of his remittances, exposed to
                    require assistance among strangers. But as the scope of my task relates more to the history of
                    his mind, than of his private affairs, I shall resume the narrative of his travels, in which
                    the curiosity of the reader ought to be more legitimately interested. </p>

                    without accident or adventure. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap21-2"> At Smyrna <persName key="LdByron">Lord Byron</persName> remained several
                    days, and saw for the first time the Turkish pastime of the Djerid, a species of tournament to
                    which he more than once alludes. I shall therefore describe the amusement. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap21-3"> The Musselim or Governor, with the chief agas of the city, mounted on horses
                    superbly caparisoned, and attended by slaves, meet, commonly on Sunday morning, on their
                    playground. Each of the riders is furnished with one or two djerids, straight white sticks, a
                    little thinner than an umbrella-stick, less at one end than at the other and about an ell in
                    length, together with a thin cane crooked at the head. The horsemen, perhaps a hundred in
                    number, gallop about in as narrow a space as possible, throwing the djerids at each other and
                    shouting. Each man then selects an opponent who has darted his djerid or is for the moment
                    without a weapon, and rushes furiously towards him, screaming &#8220;Olloh! Olloh!&#8221; The
                    other flies, looking behind him, and the instant the dart is launched stoops downwards as low
                    as possible, or wields his horse with inconceivable rapidity, and picking up a djerid with his
                    cane, or taking one from a running slave, pursues in his turn the enemy, who wheels on the
                    instant he darts his weapon. The greatest dexterity is requisite in these <pb xml:id="JG.134"/>
                    mimic battles to avoid the concurrence of the &#8220;javelin-darting crowd,&#8221; and to

                <p xml:id="chap21-4">
                    <persName key="LdByron">Byron</persName>, having satisfied his curiosity with Smyrna, which is
                    so like every other Turkish town as to excite but little interest, set out with <persName
                        key="JoHobho1869">Mr. Hobhouse</persName> on the 13th of March, for Ephesus. As I soon
                    after passed along the same road, I shall here describe what I met with myself in the course of
                    the journey, it being probable that the incidents were in few respects different from those
                    which they encountered. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap21-5"> On ascending the heights after leaving Smyrna, the road was remarkable in
                    being formed of the broken relics of ancient edifices partly macadamised. On the brow of the
                    hill I met a numerous caravan of camels coming from the interior of Asia. These ships of the
                    desert, variously loaded, were moving slowly to their port, and it seemed to me as I rode past
                    them, that the composed docile look of the animals possessed a sort of domesticated grace which
                    lessened the effect of their deformity. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap21-6"> A caravan, owing to the oriental dresses of the passengers and attendants,
                    with the numerous grotesque circumstances which it presents to the stranger, affords an amusing
                    spectacle. On the back of one camel three or four children were squabbling in a basket; in
                    another cooking utensils were clattering; and from a crib on a third a young camel looked forth
                    inquiringly on the world: a long desultory train of foot-passengers and cattle brought up the
                    rear. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap21-7"> On reaching the summit of the hills behind Smyrna the road lies through
                    fields and cotton-grounds, well cultivated and interspersed with country houses. After an easy
                    ride of three or four hours I passed through the ruins of a considerable Turkish town,
                    containing four or five mosques, one of them, a handsome building, still entire; about twenty
                    houses or so might be described as tenantable, but only a place of se-<pb xml:id="JG.135"
                    />pulchres could be more awful: it had been depopulated by the plague&#8212;all was silent, and
                    the streets were matted with thick grass. In passing through an open space, which reminded me
                    of a market-place, I heard the cuckoo with an indescribable sensation of pleasure mingled with
                    solemnity. The sudden presence of a raven at a bridal banquet could scarcely have been a
                    greater phantasma. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap21-8"> Proceeding briskly from this forsaken and dead city, I arrived in the course
                    of about half an hour at a coffee-house on the banks of a small stream, where I partook of some
                    refreshment in the shade of three or four trees, on which several storks were conjugally
                    building their nests. While resting there, I became interested in their work, and observed,
                    that when any of their acquaintances happened to fly past with a stick, they chattered a sort
                    of How-d&#8217;ye-do to one another. This civility was so uniformly and reciprocally performed,
                    that the politeness of the stork may be regarded as even less disputable than its piety. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap21-9"> The road from that coffee-house lies for a mile or two along the side of a
                    marshy lake, the environs of which are equally dreary and barren; an extensive plain succeeds,
                    on which I noticed several broken columns of marble, and the evident traces of an ancient
                    causeway, which apparently led through the water. Near the extremity of the lake was another
                    small coffee-house, with a burial-ground and a mosque near it; and about four or five miles
                    beyond I passed a spot, to which several Turks brought a coffinless corpse, and laid it on the
                    grass while they silently dug a grave to receive it. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap21-10"> The road then ascended the hills on the south side of the plain, of which
                    the marshy lake was the centre, and passed through a tract of country calculated to inspire
                    only apprehension and melancholy. Not a habitation nor vestige of living man was in sight, but
                    several cemeteries, with their dull funereal cypresses <pb xml:id="JG.136"/> and tombstones
                    served to show that the country had once been inhabited. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap21-11"> Just as the earliest stars began to twinkle I arrived at a third
                    coffee-house on the roadside, with a little mosque before it, a spreading beech tree for
                    travellers to recline under in the spring, and a rude shed for them in showers or the more
                    intense sunshine of summer. Here I rested for the night, and in the morning at daybreak resumed
                    my journey. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap21-12"> After a short ride I reached the borders of the plain of Ephesus, across
                    which I passed along a road rudely constructed, and raised above the marsh, consisting of
                    broken pillars, entablatures, and inscriptions, at the end of which two other paths diverge;
                    one strikes off to the left, and leads over the Cayster by a bridge above the castle of
                    Aiasaluk&#8212;the other, leading to the right, or west, goes directly to Scala Nuova, the
                    ancient Neapolis. By the latter <persName key="LdByron">Byron</persName> and his friend
                    proceeded towards the ferry, which they crossed, and where they found the river about the size
                    of the Cam at Cambridge, but more rapid and deeper. They then rode up the south bank, and about
                    three o&#8217;clock in the afternoon arrived at Aiasaluk, the miserable village which now
                    represents the city of Ephesus. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap21-13"> Having put up their beds in a mean khan, the only one in the town, they
                    partook of some cold provisions which they had brought with them on a stone seat by the side of
                    a fountain, on an open green near to a mosque, shaded with tall cypresses. During their repast
                    a young Turk approached the fountain, and after washing his feet and hands, mounted a flat
                    stone, placed evidently for the purpose on the top of the wall surrounding the mosque, and
                    devoutly said his prayers, totally regardless of their appearance and operations. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap21-14"> The remainder of the afternoon was spent in exploring the ruins of Aiasaluk,
                    and next morning they proceeded to examine those of the castle, and the <pb xml:id="JG.137"/>
                    mouldering magnificence of Ephesus. The remains of the celebrated temple of Diana, one of the
                    wonders of the ancient world, could not be satisfactorily traced; fragments of walls and
                    arches, which had been plated with marble, were all they could discover, with many broken
                    columns that had once been mighty in their altitude and strength: several fragments were
                    fifteen feet long, and of enormous circumference. Such is the condition of that superb edifice,
                    which was, in its glory, four hundred and twenty feet long by two hundred and twenty feet
                    broad, and adorned with more than a hundred and twenty columns sixty feet high. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap21-15"> When the travellers had satisfied their curiosity, if that can be called
                    satisfaction which found no entire form, but saw only the rubbish of desolation and the
                    fragments of destruction, they returned to Smyrna. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap21-16"> The investigation of the ruins of Ephesus was doubtless interesting at the
                    time, but the visit produced no such impression on the mind of <persName key="LdByron"
                        >Byron</persName> as might have been expected. He never directly refers to it in his works:
                    indeed, after Athens, the relics of Ephesus are things but of small import, especially to an
                    imagination which, like that of the poet, required the action of living characters to awaken
                    its dormant sympathies. </p>

                    embarked at Smyrna, in the <name type="ship">Salsette</name> frigate for Constantinople. The
                    wind was fair during the night, and at half past six next morning, the ship was off the Sygean
                    promontory, the north end of the ancient Lesbos or Mitylene. Having passed the headland, north
                    of the little town of Baba, she came in sight of Tenedos, where she anchored, and the poet went
                    on shore to view the island. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap22-2"> The port was full of small craft, which in their voyage to the Archipelago
                    had put in to wait for a change of wind, and a crowd of Turks belonging to these vessels were
                    lounging about on the shore. The town was then in ruins, having been burned to the ground by a
                    Russian squadron in the year 1807. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap22-3"> Next morning, <persName key="LdByron">Byron</persName>, with a party of
                    officers, left the ship to visit the ruins of Alexandria Troas, and landed at an open port,
                    about six or seven miles to the south of where the <name type="ship">Salsette</name> was at
                    anchor. The spot near to where they disembarked was marked by several large cannon-balls of
                    granite; for the ruins of Alexandria have long supplied the fortresses of the Dardanelles with
                    these gigantic missiles. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap22-4"> They rambled some time through the shaggy woods, with which the country is
                    covered, and the first vestiges of antiquity which attracted their attention were two <pb
                        xml:id="JG.139"/> large granite sarcophagi; a little beyond they found two or three
                    fragments of granite pillars, one of them about twenty-five feet in length, and at least five
                    in diameter. Near these they saw arches of brick-work, and on the east of them those
                    magnificent remains, to which early travellers have given the name of the palace of <persName
                        type="fiction">Priam</persName>, but which are, in fact, the ruins of ancient baths. An
                    earthquake in the course of the preceding winter had thrown down large portions of them, and
                    the internal divisions of the edifice were, in consequence, choked with huge masses of mural
                    wrecks and marbles. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap22-5"> The visitors entered the interior through a gap, and found themselves in the
                    midst of enormous ruins, enclosed on two sides by walls, raised on arches, and by piles of
                    ponderous fragments. The fallen blocks were of vast dimensions, and showed that no cement had
                    been used in the construction&#8212;an evidence of their great antiquity. In the midst of this
                    crushed magnificence stood several lofty portals and arches, pedestals of gigantic columns and
                    broken steps and marble cornices, heaped in desolate confusion. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap22-6"> From these baths the distance to the sea is between two and three
                    miles&#8212;a gentle declivity covered with low woods, and partially interspersed with spots of
                    cultivated ground. On this slope the ancient city of Alexandria Troas was built. On the
                    north-west, part of the walls, to the extent of a mile, may yet be traced; the remains of a
                    theatre are also still to be seen on the side of the hill fronting the sea, commanding a view
                    of Tenedos, Lemnos, and the whole expanse of the &#198;gean. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap22-7"> Having been conducted by the guide, whom they had brought with them from
                    Tenedos, to the principal antiquities of Alexandria Troas, the visitors returned to the
                    frigate, which immediately after got under way. On the 14th of April she came to anchor about a
                    mile and a half from Cape Janissary, the Sygean promontory, <pb xml:id="JG.140"/> where she
                    remained about a fortnight; during which ample opportunity was afforded to inspect the plain of
                    Troy, that scene of heroism, which, for three thousand years, has attracted the attention and
                    interested the feelings and fancy of the civilized world. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap22-10"> It was during the time that the <name type="ship">Salsette</name> lay off
                    Cape Janissary that <persName key="LdByron">Lord Byron</persName> first undertook to swim
                    across the Hellespont. Having crossed from the castle of Chanak-Kalessi, in a boat manned by
                    four Turks, he landed at five o&#8217;clock in the evening half a mile above the castle of
                    Chelit-Bauri, where, with an <persName key="WiEkenh1810">officer</persName> of the frigate who
                    accompanied him, they began their <pb xml:id="JG.142"/> enterprise, emulous of the renown of
                        <persName type="fiction">Leander</persName>. At first they swam obliquely upwards, rather
                    towards Nagara Point than the Dardanelles, but notwithstanding their skill and efforts they
                    made little progress. Finding it useless to struggle with the current, they then turned and
                    went with the stream, still however endeavouring to cross. It was not until they had been half
                    an hour in the water, and found themselves in the middle of the strait, about a mile and a half
                    below the castles, that they consented to be taken into the boat, which had followed them. By
                    that time the coldness of the water had so benumbed their limbs that they were unable to stand,
                    and were otherwise much exhausted. The second attempt was made on the 3d of May, when the
                    weather was warmer. They entered the water at the distance of a mile and a-half above
                    Chelit-Bauri, near a point of land on the western bank of the Bay of Maito, and swam against
                    the stream as before, but not for so long a time. In less than half an hour they came floating
                    down the current close to the ship, which was then anchored at the Dardanelles, and in passing
                    her steered for the bay behind the castle, which they soon succeeded in reaching, and landed
                    about a mile and a-half below the ship. <persName>Lord Byron</persName> has recorded that he
                    found the current very strong and the water cold; that some large fish passed him in the middle
                    of the channel, and though a little chilled he was not fatigued, and performed the feat without
                    much difficulty, but not with impunity, for by the verses in which he commemorated the exploit
                    it appears he incurred the ague. </p>

                    the actual breadth is barely one. The rapidity of the current is such that no boat can row
                    directly across, and it may in some measure be estimated from the circumstance of the whole
                    distance being accomplished by one of the parties in an hour and five, and by the other
                        (<persName key="LdByron">Byron</persName>) in an hour and ten minutes. The water was

                    are in sight, interspersed with trees and mean masses of domestic buildings. In the distance,
                    inland on the left, the redoubted Castle of the Seven Towers is seen rising above the gloomy
                    walls; and, unlike every other European city, a profound silence prevails over all. This
                    remarkable characteristic of Constantinople is owing to the very few wheel-carriages employed
                    in the city. In other respects the view around is lively, and in fine weather quickened with
                    innumerable objects in motion. In the calmest days the rippling in the flow of the Bosphorus is
                    like the running of a river. In the fifth canto of <name type="title" key="LdByron.Juan">Don

                <p xml:id="chap23-4"> This hideous picture is a striking instance of the uses to which imaginative
                    power may turn the slightest hint, and of horror augmented till it reach that extreme point at
                    which the ridiculous commences. The whole compass of English poetry affords no parallel to this
                    passage. It even exceeds the celebrated catalogue of dreadful things on the sacramental table
                    in <name type="title" key="RoBurns1796.Tam">Tam O&#8217; Shanter</name>. It is true, that the

                    in their associations than those of <persName>Burns</persName>, being mere visible images,

                    stronger emotions, than those which are associated with the sight of energy and courage, while
                    the covert insinuation, that the bird is actuated by some instigation of retribution in
                    pursuing the wolf for having run away with the bone, approaches the very point and line where
                    the horrible merges in the ludicrous. The whole passage is fearfully distinct, and though in
                    its circumstances, as the poet himself says, &#8220;sickening,&#8221; is yet an amazing display
                    of poetical power and high invention. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap23-5"> The frigate sent the travellers on shore at Tophana, from which the road
                    ascends to Pera. Near this landing-place is a large fountain, and around it a public stand of
                    horses ready saddled, attended by boys. On some of these <persName key="LdByron">Lord
                        Byron</persName> and his friend, with the officers who had accompanied them, mounted and
                    rode up the steep hill, to the principal Frank Hotel, in Pera, where they intended to lodge. In
                    the course of <pb xml:id="JG.149"/> the ride their attention was attracted to the prodigious
                    number of masterless dogs which lounge and lurk about the corners of the streets; a nuisance
                    both dangerous and disagreeable, but which the Turks not only tolerate but protect. It is no
                    uncommon thing to see a litter of puppies with their mother nestled in a mat placed on purpose
                    for them in a nook by some charitable Mussulman of the neighbourhood; for notwithstanding their
                    merciless military practices, the Turks are pitiful-hearted Titans to dumb animals and slaves.
                    Constantinople has, however, been so often and so well described, that it is unnecessary to
                    notice its different objects of curiosity here, except in so far as they have been contributory
                    to the stores of the poet. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap23-6"> The slave market was of course not unvisited, but the description in <name
                        type="title" key="LdByron.Juan">Don Juan</name> is more indebted to the author&#8217;s
                    fancy, than any of those other bright reflections of realities to which I have hitherto
                    directed the attention of the reader. The market now-a-days is in truth very uninteresting; few
                    slaves are ever to be seen in it, and the place itself has an odious resemblance to Smithfield.
                    I imagine, therefore, that the trade in slaves is chiefly managed by private bargaining. When
                    there, I saw only two men for sale, whites, who appeared very little concerned about their
                    destination, certainly not more than English rustics offering themselves for hire to the
                    farmers at a fair or market. Doubtless, there was a time when the slave market of
                    Constantinople presented a different spectacle, but the trade itself has undergone a
                    change&#8212;the Christians are now interdicted from purchasing slaves. The luxury of the guilt
                    is reserved for the exclusive enjoyment of the Turks. Still, as a description of things which
                    may have been, <persName key="LdByron">Byron&#8217;s</persName> market is probable and curious. </p>

                    cannot be denied; but the <name type="title" key="ArabianNights">Arabian tales</name> and <name
                        type="title" key="WiBeckf1844.Vathek">Vathek</name> seem to have had more influence on his
                    fancy in describing the imperial harem, than a knowledge of actual things and appearances. Not
                    that the latter are inferior to the former in beauty, or are without images and lineaments of
                    graphic distinctness, but they want that air of reality which constitutes the singular
                    excellence of his scenes drawn from nature; and there is a vagueness in them which has the
                    effect of making them obscure, and even fantastical. Indeed, except when he paints from actual
                    models, from living persons and existing things, his superiority, at least his originality, is
                    not so obvious; and thus it happens, that his gorgeous description of the sultan&#8217;s
                    seraglio is like a versified passage of an Arabian tale, while the imagery of <persName
                        type="fiction">Childe Harold&#8217;s</persName> visit to <persName key="AliPasha">Ali
                        Pashaw</persName> has all the freshness and life of an actual scene. The following is,
                    indeed, more like an imitation of <name type="title">Vathek</name>, than anything that has been
                    seen, or is in existence. I quote it for the contrast it affords to the visit referred to, and
                    in illustration of the distinction which should be made between beauties derived from actual
                    scenes and adventures, and compilations from memory and imagination, which are supposed to
                    display so much more of creative invention. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap24-1">
                    <hi rend="small-caps">Although</hi>&#160;<persName key="LdByron">Lord Byron</persName> remained
                    two months in Constantinople, and visited every object of interest and curiosity within and
                    around it, he yet brought away with him fewer poetical impressions than from any other part of
                    the Ottoman dominions; at least he has made less use in his works of what he saw and learned
                    there, than of the materials he collected in other places. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap24-2"> From whatever cause it arose, the self-abstraction which I had noticed at
                    Smyrna, was remarked about him while he was in the capital, and the same jealousy of his rank
                    was so nervously awake, that it led him to attempt an obtrusion on the ambassadorial
                    etiquettes&#8212;which he probably regretted. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap24-3"> It has grown into a custom, at Constantinople, when the foreign ministers are
                    admitted to audiences of ceremony with the sultan, to allow the subjects and travellers of
                    their respective nations to accompany them, both to swell the pomp of the spectacle, and to
                    gratify their curiosity. <persName key="RoAdair1855">Mr. Adair</persName>, our ambassador, for
                    whom the <name type="ship">Salsette</name> had been sent, had his audience of leave appointed
                    soon after <persName key="LdByron">Lord Byron&#8217;s arrival</persName>, and his Lordship was
                    particularly anxious to occupy a station of distinction in the procession. The pretension was
                    ridiculous in itself, and showed less ac-<pb xml:id="JG.154"/>quaintance with courtly
                    ceremonies than might have been expected in a person of his rank and intelligence.
                        <persName>Mr. Adair</persName> assured him that he could obtain no particular place; that
                    in the arrangements for the ceremonial, only the persons connected with the embassy could be
                    considered, and that the Turks neither acknowledged the precedence, nor could be requested to
                    consider the distinctions of our nobility. <persName>Byron</persName>, however, still
                    persisted, and the minister was obliged to refer him on the subject to the Austrian
                    Internuncio, a high authority in questions of etiquette, whose opinion was decidedly against
                    the pretension. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap24-4"> The pride of rank was indeed one of the greatest weaknesses of <persName
                        key="LdByron">Lord Byron</persName>, and everything, even of the most accidental kind,
                    which seemed to <q>come between the wind and his nobility,</q> was repelled on the spot. I
                    recollect having some debate with him once respecting a pique of etiquette, which happened
                    between him and <persName key="WiDrumm1828">Sir William Drummond</persName>, somewhere in
                    Portugal or Spain. <persName>Sir William</persName> was at the time an ambassador (not,
                    however, I believe, in the country where the incident occurred), and was on the point of taking
                    precedence in passing from one room to another, when <persName>Byron</persName> stepped in
                    before him. The action was undoubtedly rude on the part of his Lordship, even though
                        <persName>Sir William</persName> had presumed too far on his riband: to me it seemed also
                    wrong; for, by the custom of all nations from time immemorial, ambassadors have been allowed
                    their official rank in passing through foreign countries, while peers in the same circumstances
                    claim no rank at all; even in our own colonies it has been doubted if they may take precedence
                    of the legislative counsellors. But the rights of rank are best determined by the heralds, and
                    I have only to remark, that it is almost inconceivable that such things should have so morbidly
                    affected the sensibility of <persName>Lord Byron</persName>; yet they certainly did so, and
                    even to a ridiculous degree. On one occasion, <pb xml:id="JG.155"/> when he lodged in St
                    James&#8217;s Street, I recollect him rating the footman for using a double knock in accidental
                    thoughtlessness. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap24-5"> These little infirmities are, however, at most only calculated to excite a
                    smile; there is no turpitude in them, and they merit notice but as indications of the humour of
                    character. It was his Lordship&#8217;s foible to overrate his rank, to grudge his deformity
                    beyond reason, and to exaggerate the condition of his family and circumstances. But the alloy
                    of such small vanities, his caprice and feline temper, were as vapour compared with the mass of
                    rich and rare ore which constituted the orb and nucleus of his brilliancy. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap24-6"> He had not been long in Constantinople, when a change came over his
                    intentions; the journey to Persia was abandoned, and the dreams of India were dissolved. The
                    particular causes which produced this change are not very apparent&#8212;but <persName
                        key="JoHobho1869">Mr. Hobhouse</persName> was at the same time directed to return home, and
                    perhaps that circumstance had some influence on his decision, which he communicated to his
                    mother, informing her, that he should probably return to Greece. As in that letter he alludes
                    to his embarrassment on account of remittances, it is probable that the neglect of his agent,
                    with respect to them, was the main cause which induced him to determine on going no farther. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap24-7"> Accordingly, on the 14th of July, he embarked with <persName
                        key="JoHobho1869">Mr. Hobhouse</persName> and the ambassador on board the <name type="ship"
                        >Salsette</name>. It was in the course of the passage to the island of Zea, where he was
                    put on shore, that one of the most emphatic incidents of his life occurred; an incident which
                    throws a remarkable gleam into the springs and intricacies of his character&#8212;more,
                    perhaps, than anything which has yet been mentioned. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap24-8"> One day, as he was walking the quarter-deck, he lifted an ataghan (it might
                    be one of the midshipmen&#8217;s weapons), and unsheathing it, said, contem-<pb xml:id="JG.156"
                    />plating the blade, <q>&#8220;I should like to know how a person feels after committing
                        murder.&#8221;</q> By those who have inquiringly noticed the extraordinary cast of his
                    metaphysical associations, this dagger-scene must be regarded as both impressive and solemn;
                    although the wish to know how a man felt after committing murder does not imply any desire to
                    perpetrate the crime. The feeling might be appreciated by experiencing any actual degree of
                    guilt; for it is not the deed&#8212;the sentiment which follows it makes the horror. But it is
                    doing injustice to suppose the expression of such a wish dictated by desire. <persName
                        key="LdByron">Lord Byron</persName> has been heard to express, in the eccentricity of
                    conversation, wishes for a more intense knowledge of remorse than murder itself could give.
                    There is, however, a wide and wild difference between the curiosity that prompts the wish to
                    know the exactitude of any feeling or idea, and the direful passions that instigate to guilty
                    gratifications. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap24-9"> Being landed, according to his request, with his valet, two Albanians, and a
                    Tartar, on the shore of Zea, it may be easily conceived that he saw the ship depart with a
                    feeling before unfelt. It was the first time he was left companionless, and the scene around
                    was calculated to nourish stern fancies, even though there was not much of suffering to be
                    withstood. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap24-10"> The landing-place in the port of Zea, I recollect distinctly. The port
                    itself is a small land-locked gulf, or, as the Scottish Highlander would call it, a loch. The
                    banks are rocky and forbidding; the hills, which rise to the altitude of mountains, have, in a
                    long course of ages, been always inhabited by a civilized people. Their precipitous sides are
                    formed into innumerable artificial terraces, the aspect of which, austere, ruinous, and
                    ancient, produces on the mind of the stranger a sense of the presence of a greater antiquity
                    than the sight of monuments of mere labour and art. The town stands high upon the mountain, I
                        <pb xml:id="JG.157"/> counted on the lower side of the road which leads to it forty-nine of
                    those terraces at one place under me, and on the opposite hills, in several places, upwards of
                    sixty. Whether <persName key="LdByron">Lord Byron</persName> ascended to the town is doubtful.
                    I have never heard him mention that he had; and I am inclined to think that he proceeded at
                    once to Athens by one of the boats which frequent the harbour. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap24-11"> At Athens he met an old fellow-collegian, the <persName key="LdSligo"
                        >Marquis of Sligo</persName>, with whom he soon after travelled as far as Corinth; the
                    Marquis turning off there for Tripolizza, while <persName key="LdByron">Byron</persName> went
                    forward to Patras, where he had some needful business to transact with the <persName
                        key="NiStran1813">consul</persName>. He then made the tour of the Morea, in the course of
                    which he visited the vizier <persName key="VePasha1822">Velhi Pashaw</persName>, by whom he was
                    treated, as every other English traveller of the time was, with great distinction and
                    hospitality. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap24-12"> Having occasion to go back to Patras, he was seized by the local fever
                    there, and reduced to death&#8217;s door. On his recovery he returned to Athens, where he found
                    the <persName key="LdSligo">Marquis</persName>, with <persName key="HeStanh1839">Lady Hester
                        Stanhope</persName>, and <persName key="MiBruce1861">Mr. Bruce</persName>, afterward so
                    celebrated for his adventures in assisting the escape of the French general <persName
                        key="AnLaval1830">Lavalette</persName>. He took possession of the apartments which I had
                    occupied in the monastery, and made them his home during the remainder of his residence in
                    Greece; but when I returned to Athens, in October, he was not there himself. I found, however,
                    his valet, <persName key="WiFletc1831">Fletcher</persName>, in possession. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap24-13"> There is no very clear account of the manner in which <persName
                        key="LdByron">Lord Byron</persName> employed himself after his return to Athens; but
                    various intimations in his correspondence show that during the winter his pen was not idle. It
                    would, however, be to neglect an important occurrence, not to notice that during the time when
                    he was at Athens alone, the incident which he afterwards embodied in the impassioned fragments
                    of <pb xml:id="JG.158"/>
                    <name type="title" key="LdByron.Giaour">The Giaour</name> came to pass; and to apprise the
                    reader that the story is founded on an adventure which happened to himself&#8212;he was, in
                    fact, the cause of the girl being condemned, and ordered to be sewn up in a sack and thrown
                    into the sea. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap24-14"> One day, as he was returning from bathing in the Piraeus, he met the
                    procession going down to the shore to execute the sentence which the Waywode had pronounced on
                    the girl; and learning the object of the ceremony, and who was the victim, he immediately
                    interfered with great resolution; for, on observing some hesitation on the part of the leader
                    of the escort to return with him to the governor&#8217;s house, he drew a pistol and threatened
                    to shoot him on the spot. The man then turned about, and accompanied him back, when, partly by
                    bribery and entreaty, he succeeded in obtaining a pardon for her, on condition that she was
                    sent immediately out of the city. <persName key="LdByron">Byron</persName> conveyed her to the
                    monastery, and on the same night sent her off to Thebes, where she found a safe asylum. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap24-15"> With this affair, I may close his adventures in Greece; for, although he
                    remained several months subsequent at Athens, he was in a great measure stationary. His health,
                    which was never robust, was impaired by the effects of the fever, which lingered about him;
                    perhaps, too, by the humiliating anxiety he suffered on account of the uncertainty in his
                    remittances. But however this may have been, it was fortunate for his fame that he returned to
                    England at the period he did, for the climate of the Mediterranean was detrimental to his
                    constitution. The heat oppressed him so much as to be positive suffering, and scarcely had he
                    reached Malta on his way home, when he was visited again with a tertian ague. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap25-1">
                    <persName key="LdByron"><hi rend="small-caps">Lord Byron</hi></persName> arrived in London
                    about the middle of July, 1811, having been absent a few days more than two years. The
                    embarrassed condition in which he found his affairs sufficiently explains the dejection and
                    uneasiness with which he was afflicted during the latter part of his residence in Greece; and
                    yet it was not such as ought to have affected him so deeply, nor have I ever been able to
                    comprehend wherefore so much stress has been laid on his supposed friendlessness. In respect
                    both to it and to his ravelled fortune, a great deal too much has been too often said; and the
                    manliness of his character has suffered by the puling. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap25-2"> His correspondence shows that he had several friends to whom he was much
                    attached, and his disposition justifies the belief that, had he not been well persuaded the
                    attachment was reciprocal, he would not have remained on terms of intimacy with them. And
                    though for his rank not rich, he was still able to maintain all its suitable exhibition. The
                    world could never regard as an object of compassion or of sympathy an English noble, whose
                    income was enough to support his dignity among his peers, and whose poverty, however grievous
                    to his pride, caused only the privation of extravagance. But it cannot be controverted, that
                    there was an innate predilection in the mind of Lord <pb xml:id="JG.160"/>
                    <persName key="LdByron">Byron</persName> to mystify everything about himself: he was actuated
                    by a passion to excite attention, and, like every other passion, it was often indulged at the
                    expense of propriety. He had the infirmity of speaking, though vaguely, and in obscure hints
                    and allusions, more of his personal concerns than is commonly deemed consistent with a correct
                    estimate of the interest which mankind take in the cares of one another. But he lived to feel
                    and to rue the consequences: to repent he could not, for the cause was in the very element of
                    his nature. It was a blemish as incurable as the deformity of his foot. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap25-3"> On his arrival in London, his relation, <persName key="RoDalla1824">Mr.
                        Dallas</persName>, called on him, and in the course of their first brief conversation his
                    Lordship mentioned that he had written a <name type="title" key="LdByron.Hints">paraphrase of
                        Horace&#8217;s Art of Poetry</name>, but said nothing then of <name type="title"
                        key="LdByron.Harold">Childe Harold</name>, a circumstance which leads me to suspect that he
                    offered him the slighter work first, to enjoy his surprise afterward at the greater. If so, the
                    result answered the intent. <persName>Mr Dallas</persName> carried home with him the paraphrase
                    of <name type="title" key="QuHorac.Ars">Horace</name>, with which he was grievously
                    disappointed; so much so, that on meeting his Lordship again in the morning, and being
                    reluctant to speak of it as he really thought, he only expressed some surprise that his noble
                    friend should have produced nothing else during his long absence. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap25-4"> I can easily conceive the emphatic indifference, if my conjecture be well
                    founded, with which <persName key="LdByron">Lord Byron</persName> must have said to him,
                    &#8220;I have occasionally written short poems, besides a great many stanzas in Spenser&#8217;s
                    measure, relative to the countries I have visited: they are not worth troubling you with, but
                    you shall have them all with you, if you like.&#8221; </p>

                    <name type="title" key="LdByron.Harold">Childe Harold&#8217;s Pilgrimage</name> was accordingly
                    placed in his hands; <persName key="RoDalla1824">Mr. Dallas</persName> took it home, and was
                    not slow in discovering its beauties, for in the course of the same evening he despatched a
                    note to his Lordship, as fair a specimen of the style of an elderly patron-<pb xml:id="JG.161"
                    />ising gentleman as can well be imagined: <q>&#8220;You have written,&#8221; said he,
                        &#8220;one of the most delightful poems I ever read. If I wrote this in flattery, I should
                        deserve your contempt rather than your friendship. I have been so fascinated with <name
                            type="title">Childe Harold</name>, that I have not been able to lay it down; I would
                        almost pledge my life on its advancing the reputation of your poetical powers, and on its
                        gaining you great honour and regard, if you will do me the credit and favour of attending
                        to my suggestions.&#8221;</q>
                </p>

                <p xml:id="chap25-6"> For some reason or another, <persName key="LdByron">Lord Byron</persName>,
                    however, felt or feigned great reluctance to publish <name type="title" key="LdByron.Harold"
                        >Childe Harold</name>. Possibly his repugnance was dictated by diffidence, not with respect
                    to its merits, but from a consciousness that the hero of the poem exhibited traits and
                    resemblances of himself. It would indeed be injustice to his judgment and taste, to suppose he
                    was not sensible of the superiority of the terse and energetic poetry which brightens and burns
                    in every stanza of the Pilgrimage, compared with the loose and sprawling lines, and dull
                    rhythm, of the paraphrase. It is true that he alleged it had been condemned by a good
                    critic&#8212;the only one who had previously seen it&#8212;probably <persName key="JoHobho1869"
                        >Mr. Hobhouse</persName>, who was with him during the time he was writing it; but still I
                    cannot conceive he was so blind to excellence, as to prefer in sincerity the other composition,
                    which was only an imitation. But the arguments of <persName key="RoDalla1824">Mr.
                        Dallas</persName> prevailed and in due season <name type="title">Childe Harold</name> was
                    prepared for the press. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap25-7"> In the meantime, while busily engaged in his literary projects with <persName
                        key="RoDalla1824">Mr. Dallas</persName>, and in law affairs with his agent, he was suddenly
                    summoned to Newstead by the state of his <persName key="CaByron1811">mother&#8217;s</persName>
                    health: before he had reached the Abbey she had breathed her last. The event deeply affected
                    him; he had not seen her since his return, and a presentiment possessed her when they parted,
                    that she was never to see him again. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap25-8"> Notwithstanding her violent temper and other un-<pb xml:id="JG.162"/>seemly
                    conduct, her affection for him had been so fond and dear, that he undoubtedly returned it with
                    unaffected sincerity; and from many casual and incidental expressions which I have heard him
                    employ concerning her, I am persuaded that his filial love was not at any time even of an
                    ordinary kind. During her life he might feel uneasy respecting her, apprehensive on account of
                    her ungovernable passions and indiscretions, but the manner in which he lamented her death,
                    clearly proves that the integrity of his affection had never been impaired. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap25-9"> On the night after his arrival at the Abbey, the waiting-woman of <persName
                        key="CaByron1811">Mrs. Byron</persName>, in passing the door of the room where the corpse
                    lay, heard the sound of some one sighing heavily within, and on entering found his Lordship
                    sitting in the dark beside the bed. She remonstrated with him for so giving way to grief, when
                    he burst into tears, and exclaimed, <q>&#8220;I had but one friend in the world, and she is
                        gone.&#8221;</q> Of the fervency of his sorrow I do therefore think there can be no doubt;
                    the very endeavour which he made to conceal it by indifference, was a proof of its depth and
                    anguish, though he hazarded the strictures of the world by the indecorum of his conduct on the
                    occasion of the funeral. Having declined to follow the remains himself, he stood looking from
                    the hall door at the procession, till the whole had moved away; and then, turning to one of the
                        <persName key="RoRusht1827">servants</persName>, the only person left, he desired him to
                    fetch the sparring-gloves, and proceeded with him to his usual exercise. But the scene was
                    impressive, and spoke eloquently of a grieved heart; he sparred in silence all the time, and
                    the servant thought that he hit harder than was his habit: at last he suddenly flung away the
                    gloves and retired to his own room. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap25-10"> As soon as the funeral was over the publication of <name type="title"
                        key="LdByron.Harold">Childe Harold</name> was resumed, but it went slowly through the
                    press. In the meantime, an incident <pb xml:id="JG.163"/> occurred to him which deserves to be
                    noted&#8212;because it is one of the most remarkable in his life, and has given rise to
                    consequences affecting his fame&#8212;with advantage. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap25-11"> In <name type="title" key="LdByron.Bards">English Bards and Scotch
                        Reviewers</name>, he had alluded, with provoking pleasantry, to a meeting which had taken
                    place at Chalk Farm some years before, between <persName key="FrJeffr1850">Mr.
                        Jeffrey</persName>, the Edinburgh reviewer, and <persName key="ThMoore1852">Mr.
                        Moore</persName>, without recollecting, indeed without having heard, that <persName>Mr.
                        Moore</persName> had explained, through the newspapers, what was alleged to have been
                    ridiculous in the affair. This revival of the subject, especially as it called in question the
                    truth of <persName>Mr. Moore&#8217;s</persName> statement, obliged that gentleman to demand an
                    explanation; but <persName key="LdByron">Lord Byron</persName>, being abroad, did not receive
                    this letter, and of course knew not of its contents, so that, on his return, <persName>Mr.
                        Moore</persName> was induced to address his Lordship again. The correspondence which ensued
                    is honourable to the spirit and feelings of both. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap25-12">
                    <persName key="ThMoore1852">Mr. Moore</persName>, after referring to his first letter, restated
                    the nature of the insult which the passage in the note to the poem was calculated to convey,
                    adding, <q>&#8220;It is now useless to speak of the steps with which it was my intention to
                        follow up that letter, the time which has elapsed since then, though it has done away
                        neither the injury nor the feeling of it, has, in many respects, materially altered my
                        situation, and the only object I have now in writing to your Lordship, is to preserve some
                        consistency with that former letter, and to prove to you that the injured feeling still
                        exists, however circumstances may compel me to be deaf to its dictates at present. When I
                        say &#8216;injured feeling,&#8217; let me assure your Lordship that there is not a single
                        vindictive sentiment in my mind towards you; I mean but to express that uneasiness under
                        what I consider to be a charge of falsehood, which must haunt a man of any feeling to his
                        grave, unless the insult be retracted, or atoned for, and which, if I did not feel, I
                        should <pb xml:id="JG.164"/> indeed deserve far worse than your Lordship&#8217;s satire
                        could inflict upon me.&#8221;</q> And he concluded by saying, that so far from being
                    influenced by any angry or resentful feeling, it would give him sincere pleasure if, by any
                    satisfactory explanation, his Lordship would enable him to seek the honour of being ranked
                    among his acquaintance. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap25-13"> The answer of <persName key="LdByron">Lord Byron</persName> was diplomatic
                    but manly. He declared that he never received <persName key="ThMoore1852">Mr.
                        Moore&#8217;s</persName> letter, and assured him that in whatever part of the world it had
                    reached him, he would have deemed it his duty to return and answer it in person; that he knew
                    nothing of the advertisement to which <persName>Mr. Moore</persName> had alluded, and
                    consequently could not have had the slightest idea of &#8220;giving the lie&#8221; to an
                    address which he had never seen. <q>&#8220;When I put my name to the production,&#8221; said
                        his Lordship, &#8220;which has occasioned this correspondence, I became responsible to all
                        whom it might concern, to explain where it requires explanation, and where insufficiently
                        or too sufficiently explicit, at all events to satisfy; my situation leaves me no choice;
                        it rests with the injured and the angry to obtain reparation in their own way. With regard
                        to the passage in question, <hi rend="italic">you</hi> were certainly <hi rend="italic"
                            >not</hi> the person towards whom I felt personally hostile: on the contrary, my whole
                        thoughts were engrossed by one whom I had reason to consider as my worst literary enemy,
                        nor could I foresee that his former antagonist was about to become his champion. You do not
                        specify what you would wish to have done. I can neither retract nor apologize for a charge
                        of falsehood which I never advanced.&#8221;</q>
                </p>

                <p xml:id="chap25-15"> In reply, <persName key="ThMoore1852">Mr. Moore</persName> commenced by
                    acknowledging that his Lordship&#8217;s letter was upon the whole as satisfactory as he could
                    expect; and after alluding to specific circumstances in the case, concluded thus: <q>&#8220;As
                        your Lordship does not show any wish to proceed beyond the rigid formulary of explanation,
                        it is <pb xml:id="JG.165"/> not for me to make any farther advances. We Irishmen, in
                        business of this kind, seldom know any medium between decided hostility and decided
                        friendship. But as any approaches towards the latter alternative must now depend entirely
                        on your Lordship, I have only to repeat that I am satisfied with your letter.&#8221;</q>
                    Here the correspondence would probably, with most people, have been closed, but <persName
                        key="LdByron">Lord Byron&#8217;s</persName> sensibility was interested, and would not let
                    it rest. Accordingly, on the following day, he rejoined: <q>&#8220;Soon after my return to
                        England, my friend <persName key="FrHodgs1852">Mr. Hodgson</persName> apprised me that a
                        letter for me was in his possession; but a domestic event hurrying me from London
                        immediately after, the letter, which may most probably be your own, is still unopened in
                        his keeping. If, on examination of the address, the similarity of the handwriting should
                        lead to such a conclusion, it shall be opened in your presence, for the satisfaction of all
                        parties. Mr. H. is at present out of town; on Friday I shall see him, and request him to
                        forward it to my address. With regard to the latter part of both your letters, until the
                        principal point was discussed between us, I felt myself at a loss in what manner to reply.
                        Was I to anticipate friendship from one who conceived me to have charged him with
                        falsehood? were not advances under such circumstances to be misconstrued, not perhaps by

                        impracticable. If you, who conceived yourself to be the offended person, are satisfied that
                        you had no cause for offence, it will not be difficult to convince me of it. My situation,
                        as I have before stated, leaves me no choice. I should have felt proud of your acquaintance
                        had it commenced under other circumstances, but it must rest with you to determine how far
                        it may proceed after so <hi rend="italic">auspicious</hi> a beginning.&#8221;</q>

                    returned to England, I was frequently with him. <name type="title" key="LdByron.Harold">Childe
                        Harold</name> was not then published; and although the impression of his satire, <name

                    strong upon the public, he could not well be said to have been then a celebrated character. At
                    that time the strongest feeling by which he appeared to be actuated was indignation against a
                        <persName key="HeClark1845">writer</persName> in a scurrilous publication, called <name
                        type="title" key="Scourge">The Scourge</name>; in which he was not only treated with
                    unjustifiable malignity, but charged with being, as he told me himself, the illegitimate son of
                    a murderer. I had not read the work; but the writer who could make such an absurd accusation,
                    must have been strangely ignorant of the very circumstances from which he derived the materials
                    of his own libel. When <persName key="LdByron">Lord Byron</persName> mentioned the subject to
                    me, and that he was consulting <persName key="ViGibbs1820">Sir Vickery Gibbs</persName>, with
                    the intention of prosecuting the publisher and the author, I advised him, as well as I could,
                    to desist, simply because the allegation referred to well-known occurrences. His <persName

                    return. I recollect one night meeting him at the Opera. <pb xml:id="JG.170"/> Seeing me with a
                    gentleman whom he did not know, and to whom he was unknown, he addressed me in Italian, and we
                    continued to converse for some time in that language. My friend, who in the meanwhile had been
                    observing him with curiosity, conceiving him to be a foreigner, inquired in the course of the
                    evening who he was, remarking that he had never seen a man with such a
                        <persName>Cain</persName>-like mark on the forehead before, alluding to that singular scowl
                    which struck me so forcibly when I first saw him, and which appears to have made a stronger
                    impression upon me than it did upon many others. I never, in fact, could overcome entirely the
                    prejudice of the first impression, although I ought to have been gratified by the friendship
                    and confidence with which he always appeared disposed to treat me. When <name type="title"

                    for a new edition, and which contains, in his own writing, these six lines in no other copy: </p>

                    breeze, she was neither crank nor unsteady. On the contrary, the more he became an object of
                    public interest, the less did he indulge his capricious humour. About the time when <name
                        type="title" key="LdByron.Bride">The Bride of Abydos</name> was published, he appeared
                    disposed to settle into a consistent character&#8212;especially after the first sale of
                    Newstead. Before that particular event, he was often so disturbed <pb xml:id="JG.171"/> in his
                    mind, that he could not conceal his unhappiness, and frequently spoke of leaving England for
                    ever. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap26-5"> Although few men were more under the impulses of passion than <persName
                        key="LdByron">Lord Byron</persName>, there was yet a curious kind of management about him
                    which showed that he was well aware how much of the world&#8217;s favour was to be won by it.
                    Long before <name type="title" key="LdByron.Harold">Childe Harold</name> appeared, it was
                    generally known that he had a poem in the press, and various surmises to stimulate curiosity
                    were circulated concerning it: I do not say that these were by his orders, or under his
                    directions, but on one occasion I did fancy that I could discern a touch of his own hand in a
                    paragraph in the <name type="title" key="MorningPost">Morning Post</name>, in which he was
                    mentioned as having returned from an excursion into the interior of Africa; and when I alluded
                    to it, my suspicion was confirmed by his embarrassment. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap26-6"> I mention this incident not in the spirit of detraction; for in the paragraph
                    there was nothing of puff, though certainly something of oddity&#8212;but as a tint of
                    character, indicative of the appetite for distinction by which, about this period, he became so
                    powerfully incited, that at last it grew into a diseased crave, and to such a degree, that were
                    the figure allowable, it might be said, the mouth being incapable of supplying adequate means
                    to appease it&#8212;every pore became another mouth greedy of nourishment. I am, however,
                    hastening on too fast. <persName key="LdByron">Lord Byron</persName> was, at that time, far
                    indeed from being ruled by any such inordinate passion; the fears, the timidity, and
                    bashfulness of young desire still clung to him, and he was throbbing with doubt if he should be
                    found worthy of the high prize for which he was about to offer himself a candidate. The course
                    he adopted on the occasion, whether dictated by management, or the effect of accident, was,
                    however, well calculated to attract attention to his debut as a public man. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap26-7"> When <name type="title" key="LdByron.Harold">Childe Harold</name> was ready
                    for publication, he <pb xml:id="JG.172"/> determined to make his first appearance as an orator
                    in the House of Lords: the occasion was judiciously chosen, being a debate on the Nottingham
                    frame-breaking bill; a subject on which it was natural to suppose he possessed some local
                    knowledge that might bear upon a question directed so exclusively against transactions in his
                    own county. He prepared himself as the best orators do in their first essays, not only by
                    composing, but writing down, the whole of his speech beforehand. The reception he met with was
                    flattering; he was complimented warmly by some of the speakers on his own side; but it must be
                    confessed that his debut was more showy than promising. It lacked weight in metal, as was
                    observed at the time, and the mode of delivery was more like a schoolboy&#8217;s recital than a
                    masculine grapple with an argument. It was, moreover, full of rhetorical exaggerations, and
                    disfigured with conceits. Still it scintillated with talent, and justified the opinion that he
                    was an extraordinary young man, probably destined to distinction, though he might not be a
                    statesman. </p>

                        and met him in the passage; he was glowing with success, and much agitated. I had an
                        umbrella in my right hand, not expecting that he would put out his hand to me; in my haste
                        to take it when offered, I had advanced my left hand: <q>&#8216;What!&#8217; said he,
                            &#8216;give your friend your left hand upon such an occasion?&#8217;</q> I showed the
                        cause, and immediately changing the umbrella to the other, I gave him my right hand, which
                        he shook and pressed warmly. He was greatly elated, and repeated some of the compliments
                        which had been paid him, and mentioned one or two of the peers who had desired to be
                        introduced to him. He concluded by saying, that he had, by his speech, given me the best
                        advertisement for <name type="title" key="LdByron.Harold">Childe Harold&#8217;s
                            Pilgrimage</name>.&#8221;</q>
                </p>

                <p xml:id="chap26-9"> It is upon this latter circumstance, that I have ven-<pb xml:id="JG.173"
                    />tured to state my suspicion, that there was a degree of worldly management in making his
                    first appearance in the House of Lords, so immediately preceding the publication of his poem.
                    The speech was, indeed, a splendid advertisement, but the greater and brighter merits of the
                    poem soon proved that it was not requisite, for the speech made no impression, but the poem was
                    at once hailed with delight and admiration. It filled a vacancy in the public mind, which the
                    excitement and inflation arising from the mighty events of the age, had created. The world, in
                    its condition and circumstances, was prepared to receive a work, so original, vigorous, and
                    beautiful; and the reception was such that there was no undue extravagance in the noble author
                    saying in his memorandum, <q>&#8220;I awoke one morning and found myself famous.&#8221;</q>

                <p xml:id="chap26-10"> But he was not to be allowed to revel in such triumphant success with
                    impunity. If the great spirits of the time were smitten with astonishment at the splendour of
                    the rising fire, the imps and elves of malignity and malice fluttered their bat-wings in all
                    directions. Those whom the poet had afflicted in his satire, and who had remained quietly
                    crouching with lacerated shoulders in the hope that their flagellation would be forgotten, and
                    that the avenging demon who had so punished their imbecility would pass away, were terrified
                    from their obscurity. They came like moths to the candle, and sarcasms in the satire which had
                    long been unheeded, in the belief that they would soon be forgotten, were felt to have been
                    barbed with irremediable venom, when they beheld the avenger <q>

                    <hi rend="small-caps">For</hi> some time after the publication of <name type="title"
                        key="LdByron.Harold">Childe Harold</name>, the noble author appeared to more advantage than
                    I ever afterwards saw him. He was soothed by success; and the universal applause which attended
                    his poem seemed to make him think more kindly of the world, of which he has too often
                    complained, while it would be difficult to discover, in his career and fortunes, that he had
                    ever received any cause from it to justify his complaint. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap27-2"> At no time, I imagine, could it be said that <persName key="LdByron">Lord
                        Byron</persName> was one of those men who interest themselves in the concerns of others. He
                    had always too much to do with his own thoughts about himself, to afford time for the
                    consideration of aught that was lower in his affections. But still he had many amiable fits,
                    and at the particular period to which I allude, he evinced a constancy in the disposition to
                    oblige, which proved how little self-control was wanting to have made him as pleasant as he was
                    uniformly interesting. I felt this towards myself in a matter which had certainly the grace of
                    condescension in it, at the expense of some trouble to him. I then lived at the corner of
                    Bridge Street, Westminster, and in going to the House of Lords he frequently stopped to inquire
                    if I wanted a frank. His conversation, at the same time, was of a milder vein, and with the
                    single exception of <pb xml:id="JG.175"/> one day, while dining together at the St
                    Alban&#8217;s, it was light and playful, as if gaiety had become its habitude. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap27-3"> Perhaps I regarded him too curiously, and more than once it struck me that he
                    thought so. For at times, when he was in his comfortless moods, he has talked of his affairs
                    and perplexities as if I had been much more acquainted with them than I had any opportunity of
                    being. But he was a subject for study, such as is rarely met with&#8212;at least, he was so to
                    me; for his weaknesses were as interesting as his talents, and he often indulged in expressions
                    which would have been blemishes in the reflections of other men, but which in him often proved
                    the germs of philosophical imaginings. He was the least qualified for any sort of business of
                    all men I have ever known; so skinless in sensibility as respected himself, and so distrustful
                    in his universal apprehensions of human nature, as respected others. It was, indeed, a wild,
                    though a beautiful, error of nature, to endow a spirit with such discerning faculties, and yet
                    render it unfit to deal with mankind. But these reflections belong more properly to a general
                    estimate of his character, than to the immediate purpose before me, which was principally to
                    describe the happy effects which the splendid reception of <name type="title"
                        key="LdByron.Harold">Childe Harold</name> had on his feelings; effects which, however, did
                    not last long. He was gratified to the fullness of his hopes; but the adulation was enjoyed to
                    excess, and his infirmities were aggravated by the surfeit. I did not, however, see the
                    progress of the change, as in the course of the summer I went to Scotland, and soon after again
                    abroad. But on my return, in the following spring, it was very obvious. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap27-4"> I found him, in one respect, greatly improved; there was more of a formed
                    character about him; he was evidently, at the first glance, more mannered, or endeavouring to
                    be so, and easier with the proprieties of his rank; but he had risen in his own estimation <pb
                        xml:id="JG.176"/> above the honours so willingly paid to his genius, and was again longing
                    for additional renown. Not content with being acknowledged as the first poet of the age, and a
                    respectable orator in the House of Lords, he was aspiring to the eclat of a man of gallantry;
                    so that many of the most ungracious peculiarities of his temper, though brought under better
                    discipline, were again in full activity. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap27-5"> Considering how much he was then caressed, I ought to have been proud of the
                    warmth with which he received me. I did not, however, so often see him as in the previous year;
                    for I was then on the eve of my marriage, and I should not so soon, after my return to London,
                    have probably renewed my visits, but a foreign nobleman of the highest rank, who had done me
                    the honour to treat me as a friend, came at that juncture to this country, and knowing I had
                    been acquainted with <persName key="LdByron">Lord Byron</persName>, he requested me to
                    introduce him to his Lordship. This rendered a visit preliminary to the introduction necessary;
                    and so long as my distinguished friend remained in town, we again often met. But after he left
                    the country my visits became few and far between; owing to nothing but that change in a
                    man&#8217;s pursuits and associates which is one among some of the evils of matrimony. It is
                    somewhat remarkable, that of the last visit I ever paid him, he has made rather a particular
                    memorandum. I remember well, that it was in many respects an occasion not to be at once
                    forgotten; for, among other things, after lighter topics, he explained to me a variety of
                    tribulations in his affairs, and I urged him, in consequence, to marry, with the frankness
                    which his confidence encouraged; subjoining certain items of other good advice concerning a
                    liaison which he was supposed to have formed, and which <persName key="ThMoore1852">Mr.
                        Moore</persName> does not appear to have known, though it was much talked of at the time. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap27-6"> During that visit the youthful peculiarities of his <pb xml:id="JG.177"/>
                    temper and character showed all their original blemish. But, as usual, when such was the case,
                    he was often more interesting than when in his discreeter moods. He gave me the copy of <name
                        key="LdByron.Bride">The Bride of Abydos</name>, with a very kind inscription on it, which I
                    have already mentioned; but still there was an impression on my mind that led me to believe he
                    could not have been very well pleased with some parts of my counselling. This, however, appears
                    not to have been the case; on the contrary, the tone of his record breathes something of
                    kindness; and long after I received different reasons to believe his recollection of me was
                    warm and friendly. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap27-7"> When he had retired to Genoa, I gave a gentleman a letter to him, partly that
                    I might hear something of his real way of life, and partly in the hope of gratifying my friend
                    by the sight of one of whom he had heard so much. The reception from his Lordship was
                    flattering to me; and, as the account of it contains what I think a characteristic picture, the
                    reader will, I doubt not, be pleased to see so much of it as may be made public without
                    violating the decorum which should always be observed in describing the incidents of private
                    intercourse, when the consent of all parties cannot be obtained to the publication. </p>

                                recollection of my agreeable interview with <persName key="LdByron">Lord
                                    Byron</persName>, at Genoa, in May, 1823, so long a time has since elapsed that
                                much of the aroma of the pleasure has evaporated, and I can but recall
                                generalities. At that time there was an impression in Genoa that he was averse to
                                receive visits from Englishmen, and I was indeed advised not to think of calling on
                                him, as I might run the risk of meeting with a savage reception. However, I
                                resolved to send your note, and to the surprise of every one the messenger brought
                                a most polite answer, in which, after expressing the satisfaction of <pb
                                    xml:id="JG.178"/> hearing of his old friend and fellow-traveller, he added that
                                he would do himself the honour of calling on me the next day, which he accordingly
                                did; but owing to the officious blundering of an Italian waiter, who mentioned I
                                was at dinner, his Lordship sent up his card with his compliments that he would not
                                    <hi rend="italic"><foreign>deranger</foreign></hi> the party. I was determined,
                                however, that he should not escape me in this way, and drove out to his residence
                                next morning, when, upon his English valet taking up my name, I was immediately
                                admitted. </p>

                            <p xml:id="chap27.1-2"> &#8220;As every one forms a picture to himself of remarkable
                                characters, I had depicted his Lordship in my mind as a tall, sombre, <persName
                                    type="fiction">Childe Harold</persName> personage, tinctured somewhat with
                                aristocratic hauteur. You may therefore guess my surprise when the door opened, and
                                I saw leaning upon the lock, a light animated figure, rather <hi rend="italic"
                                    >petite</hi> than otherwise, dressed in a nankeen hussar-braided jacket,
                                trousers of the same material, with a white waistcoat; his countenance pale but the
                                complexion clear and healthful, with the hair coming down in little curls on each
                                side of his fine forehead. </p>

                            <p xml:id="chap27.1-3"> &#8220;He came towards me with an easy cheerfulness of manner,
                                and after some preliminary inquiries concerning yourself, we entered into a
                                conversation which lasted two hours, in the course of which I felt myself perfectly
                                at ease, from his Lordship&#8217;s natural and simple manners; indeed, so much so,
                                that, forgetting all my anticipations, I found myself conversing with him with as
                                fluent an intercourse of mind as I ever experienced, even with yourself. </p>

                            <p xml:id="chap27.1-4"> &#8220;It is impossible for me at present to overtake a detail
                                of what passed, but as it produced a kind of scene, I may mention one incident. </p>

                            <p xml:id="chap27.1-5"> &#8220;Having remarked that in a long course of desultory
                                reading, I had read most of what had been said by English travellers concerning
                                Italy; yet, on coming to it I found there was no country of which I had less <pb
                                    xml:id="JG.179"/> accurate notions: that among other things I was much struck
                                with the harshness of the language. He seemed to jerk at this, and immediately
                                observed, that perhaps in going rapidly through the country, I might not have had
                                many opportunities of hearing it politely spoken. <q>&#8216;Now,&#8217; said he,
                                    &#8216;there are supposed to be nineteen dialects of the Italian language, and
                                    I shall let you hear a lady speak the principal of them, who is considered to

                                considered it would afford me an opportunity of seeing the far-famed <persName
                                    key="TeGuicc1873">Countess Guiccioli</persName>. His Lordship immediately rose
                                and left the apartment, returning in the course of a minute or two leading in the
                                lady, and while arranging chairs for the trio, he said to me, <q>&#8216;I shall
                                    make her speak each of the principal dialects, but you are not to mind how I
                                    pronounce, for I do not speak Italian well.&#8217;</q> After the scene had been
                                performed he resumed to me, <q>&#8216;Now what do you think?&#8217;</q> To which I
                                answered, that my opinion still remained unaltered. He seemed at this to fall into
                                a little revery, and then said, abruptly, <persName>&#8216;Why &#8217;tis very odd,
                                        <persName key="ThMoore1852">Moore</persName> thought the

                                <q>&#8216;Does your Lordship mean Tom Moore?&#8217;</q>
                                <q>&#8216;Yes.&#8217;</q>
                                <q>&#8216;Ah, then, my Lord, I shall adhere with more pertinacity to my opinion,
                                    when I hear that a man of his exquisite taste in poetry and harmony was also of
                                    that opinion.&#8217;</q>

                                certainly heard much of her high personal attractions, but all I can say is, that
                                in my eyes her graces did not rank above mediocrity. They were youth, plumpness,

                    to myself, and moreover is characteristic of the excoriated sensibility with which his Lordship

                    coincidence in the story, with a matter in which I had been interested. I have no copy of the

                                assure you of the truth, viz. that I had not wittingly seized upon plot, sentiment,

                                part, where you have found a coincidence in some events within your observations on

                                though admitting of very powerful feeling and description, yet is not adapted for
                                this age, at least this country. Though the finest works of the Greeks, one of

                                incidents of a similar cast, I therefore altered it as you perceive, and in so
                                doing have weakened the whole, by interrupting the train of thought; and in
                                composition I do not think <hi rend="italic">second</hi> thoughts are the best,

                    the 12th, he made the following other note in his memorandum book: </p>

                <p xml:id="chap28-7">
                    <q> &#8220;By <persName key="JoGalt1839">Galt&#8217;s</persName> answer, I find it is some
                        story in <hi rend="italic">real</hi> life, and not any work with which my late composition
                        coincides. It is still more singular, for mine is drawn from <hi rend="italic"
                            >existence</hi> also.&#8221; </q>
                </p>

                <p xml:id="chap28-8"> The most amusing part of this little fracas is the denial of his Lordship, as
                    to pilfering the thoughts and fancies of others; for it so happens, that the first passage of
                        <name type="title" key="LdByron.Bride">The Bride of Abydos</name>, the poem in question, is
                    almost a literal and unacknowledged translation from <persName key="JoGoeth1832"
                        >Goethe</persName>, which was pointed out in some of the periodicals soon after the work
                    was published. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap28-9"> Then, as to his not thieving from me or mine, I believe the fact to be as he
                    has stated; but there are singular circumstances connected with some of his other productions,
                    of which the account is at least curious. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap28-10"> On leaving England I began to write a poem in the Spenserian measure. It was
                    called <name type="title" key="JoGalt1839.Unknown">The Unknown</name>, and was intended to
                    describe, in narrating the voyages and adventures of a pilgrim, who had embarked for the Holy
                    Land, the scenes I expected to visit. I was occasionally engaged in this composition during the
                    passage with <persName key="LdByron">Lord Byron</persName> from Gibraltar to Malta, and he knew
                    what I was about. In stating this, I beg to be distinctly understood, as in no way whatever
                    intending to insinuate that this work had any influence on the composition of <name
                        type="title" key="LdByron.Harold">Childe Harold&#8217;s Pilgrimage</name>, which
                        <persName>Lord Byron</persName> began to write in Albania; but it must be considered as
                    something extraordinary, that the two works should have been so similar in plan, <pb
                        xml:id="JG.183"/> and in the structure of the verse. His Lordship never saw my attempt that
                    I know of, nor did I his poem until it was printed. It is needless to add, that beyond the plan
                    and verse there was no other similarity between the two works; I wish there had been. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap28-11"> His Lordship has published a poem, called <name type="title"
                        key="LdByron.Curse">The Curse of Minerva</name>, the subject of which is the vengeance of
                    the goddess on <persName key="LdElgin7">Lord Elgin</persName> for the rape of the Parthenon. It
                    has so happened that I wrote at Athens a burlesque poem on nearly the same subject (mine
                    relates to the vengeance of all the gods) which I called <name type="title"

                    <hi rend="small-caps">The</hi> year 1813 was perhaps the period of all <persName key="LdByron"
                        >Lord Byron&#8217;s</persName> life in which he was seen to most advantage. The fame of
                        <name type="title" key="LdByron.Harold">Childe Harold</name> was then in its brightest
                    noon; and in that year he produced <name type="title" key="LdByron.Giaour">The Giaour</name>
                    and <name type="title" key="LdByron.Bride">The Bride of Abydos</name>&#8212;compositions not
                    only of equal power, but even tinted with superior beauties. He was himself soothed by the full
                    enjoyment of his political rank and station; and though his manners and character had not
                    exactly answered to the stern and stately imaginations which had been formed of his
                    dispositions and appearance, still he was acknowledged to be no common man, and his company in
                    consequence was eagerly courted. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap29-2"> It forms no part of the plan of this work to repeat the gossip and tattle of
                    private society, but occurrences happened to <persName key="LdByron">Lord Byron</persName>
                    which engaged both, and some of them cannot well be passed over unnoticed. One of these took
                    place during the spring of this year, and having been a subject of newspaper remark, it may
                    with less impropriety be mentioned than others which were more indecorously made the topics of
                    general discussion. The incident alluded to was an extravagant scene enacted by a <persName
                        key="CaLamb1828">lady</persName> of high rank, at a rout given by <persName
                        key="CaHeath1825">Lady Heathcote</persName>; in which, in revenge, as it was reported, for
                    having been rejected <pb xml:id="JG.187"/> by <persName>Lord Byron</persName>, she made a
                    suicidal attempt with an instrument, which scarcely penetrated, if it could even inflict any
                    permanent mark on, the skin. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap29-3"> The insane attachment of this eccentric <persName key="CaLamb1828"
                        >lady</persName> to his Lordship was well known; insane is the only epithet that can be
                    applied to the actions of a married woman, who, in the disguise of her page, flung herself to a
                    man, who, as she told a friend of mine, was ashamed to be in love with her because she was not
                    beautiful&#8212;an expression at once curious and just, evincing a shrewd perception of the
                    springs of his Lordship&#8217;s conduct, and the acuteness blended with frenzy and talent which
                    distinguished herself. <persName key="LdByron">Lord Byron</persName> unquestionably at that
                    time cared little for her. In showing me her picture, some two or three days after the affair,
                    and laughing at the absurdity of it, he bestowed on her the endearing diminutive of vixen, with
                    a hard-hearted adjective that I judiciously omit. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap29-4"> The immediate cause of this tragical flourish was never very well understood;
                    but in the course of the evening she had made several attempts to fasten on his Lordship, and
                    was shunned: certain it is, she had not, like <persName key="EdBurke1797">Burke</persName> in
                    the House of Commons, premeditatedly brought a dagger in her reticule, on purpose for the
                    scene; but, seeing herself an object of scorn, she seized the first weapon she could
                    find&#8212;some said a pair of scissors&#8212;others, more scandalously, broken jelly-glass,
                    and attempted an incision of the jugular, to the consternation of all the dowagers, and the
                    pathetic admiration of every Miss who witnessed or heard of the rapture. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap29-5">
                    <persName key="LdByron">Lord Byron</persName> at the time was in another room, talking with
                        <persName>Prince K&#8212;</persName>, when <persName>Lord P&#8212;</persName> came, with a
                    face full of consternation, and told them what had happened. The cruel poet, instead of being
                    agitated by the tidings, or standing in the smallest degree in need of a smelling-bottle,
                    knitted his scowl, and said, with a contemptuous indifference, &#8220;It is only a
                    trick.&#8221; <pb xml:id="JG.188"/> All things considered, he was perhaps not uncharitable; and
                    a man of less vanity would have felt pretty much as his Lordship appeared to do on the
                    occasion. The whole affair was eminently ridiculous; and what increased the absurdity was a
                    letter she addressed to a friend of mine on the subject, and which he thought too good to be
                    reserved only for his own particular study. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap29-6"> It was in this year that <persName key="LdByron">Lord Byron</persName> first
                    proposed for <persName key="LyByron">Miss Milbanke</persName>; having been urged by several of
                    his friends to marry, that lady was specially recommended to him for a wife. It has been
                    alleged, that he deeply resented her rejection of his proposal; and I doubt not, in the first
                    instance, his vanity may have been a little piqued; but as he cherished no very animated
                    attachment to her, and moreover, as she enjoyed no celebrity in public opinion to make the
                    rejection important, the resentment was not, I am persuaded, either of an intense or vindictive
                    kind. On the contrary, he has borne testimony to the respect in which he held her character and
                    accomplishments; and an incidental remark in his journal, <q>&#8220;I shall be in love with her
                        again, if I don&#8217;t take care,&#8221;</q> is proof enough that his anger was not of a
                    very fierce or long-lived kind. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap29-7"> The account ascribed to him of his introduction to <persName key="LyByron"
                        >Miss Milbanke</persName>, and the history of their attachment, ought not to be omitted,
                    because it serves to illustrate, in some degree, the state of his feelings towards her, and is
                    so probable, that I doubt not it is in the main correct:&#8212; </p>

                <p xml:id="chap29-8">
                    <q> &#8220;The first time of my seeing <persName key="LyByron">Miss Milbanke</persName> was at
                            <persName key="LyMelbo1">Lady ****&#8217;s</persName>. It was a fatal day; and I
                        remember, that in going upstairs I stumbled, and remarked to <persName key="ThMoore1852"
                            >Moore</persName>, who accompanied me, that it was a bad omen. I ought to have taken
                        the warning. On entering the room, I observed a young lady more simply dressed than the
                        rest of the assembly sitting <pb xml:id="JG.189"/> alone upon a sofa. I took her for a
                        female companion, and asked if I was right in my conjecture. <q>&#8216;She is a great
                            heiress,&#8217;</q> said he, in a whisper, that became lower as he proceeded,
                            <q>&#8216;you had better marry her, and repair the old place, Newstead.&#8217;</q>
                    </q>
                </p>

                <p xml:id="chap29-9">
                    <q> &#8220;There was something piquant, and what we term pretty, in <persName key="LyByron"
                            >Miss Milbanke</persName>. Her features were small and feminine, though not regular.
                        She had the fairest skin imaginable. Her figure was perfect for her height, and there was a
                        simplicity, a retired modesty about her, which was very characteristic, and formed a happy
                        contrast to the cold artificial formality and studied stiffness which is called fashion.
                        She interested me exceedingly. I became daily more attached to her, and it ended in my
                        making her a proposal, that was rejected. Her refusal was couched in terms which could not
                        offend me. I was, besides, persuaded, that in declining my offer, she was governed by the
                        influence of her mother; and was the more confirmed in my opinion, by her reviving our
                        correspondence herself twelve months after. The tenour of her letter was, that, although
                        she could not love me, she desired my friendship. Friendship is a dangerous word for young
                        ladies; it is love full-fledged, and waiting for a fine day to fly.&#8221; </q>
                </p>

                <p xml:id="chap29-10"> But <persName key="LdByron">Lord Byron</persName> possessed this sort of
                    irrepressible predilections&#8212;was so much the agent of impulses, that he could not keep
                    long in unison with the world, or in harmony with his friends. Without malice, or the
                    instigation of any ill spirit, he was continually provoking malignity and revenge. His <name
                        type="title" key="LdByron.LadyWeeping">verses on the Princess Charlotte weeping</name>, and
                    his other merciless satire on her father, begot him no friends, and armed the hatred of his
                    enemies. There was, indeed, something like ingratitude in the attack on the <persName
                        key="George4">Regent</persName>, for his Royal Highness had been particularly civil; had
                    intimated a wish to have him introduced to him; and <persName>Byron</persName>, fond of the
                    distinction, spoke of it with a <pb xml:id="JG.190"/> sense of gratification. These instances,
                    as well as others, of gratuitous spleen, only justified the misrepresentations which had been
                    insinuated against himself, and what was humour in his nature, was ascribed to vice in his
                    principles. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap29-11"> Before the year was at an end, his popularity was evidently beginning to
                    wane: of this he was conscious himself, and braved the frequent attacks on his character and
                    genius with an affectation of indifference, under which those who had at all observed the
                    singular associations of his recollections and ideas, must have discerned the symptoms of a
                    strange disease. He was tainted with a Herodian malady of the mind: his thoughts were often
                    hateful to himself; but there was an ecstasy in the conception, as if delight could be mingled
                    with horror. I think, however, he struggled to master the fatality, and that his resolution to
                    marry was dictated by an honourable desire to give hostages to society, against the wild
                    wilfulness of his imagination. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap29-12"> It is a curious and a mystical fact, that at the period to which I am
                    alluding, and a very short time, only a little month, before he successfully solicited the hand
                    of <persName key="LyByron">Miss Milbanke</persName>, being at Newstead, he fancied that he saw
                    the ghost of the monk which is supposed to haunt the abbey, and to make its ominous appearance
                    when misfortune or death impends over the master of the mansion.&#8212;The story of the
                    apparition in the sixteenth canto of <name type="title" key="LdByron.Juan">Don Juan</name> is
                    derived from this family legend, and Norman Abbey, in the thirteenth of the same poem, is a

                    been accepted, a considerable time, nearly three months, elapsed before the marriage was
                    completed, in consequence of the embarrassed condition in which, when the necessary settlements
                    were to be made, he found his affairs. This state of things, with the previous unhappy
                    controversy with himself, and anger at the <pb xml:id="JG.191"/> world, was ill-calculated to
                    gladden his nuptials: but, besides these real evils, his mind was awed with gloomy
                    presentiments, a shadow of some advancing misfortune darkened his spirit, and the ceremony was
                    performed with sacrificial feelings, and those dark and chilling circumstances, which he has so
                    touchingly described in <name type="title" key="LdByron.Dream">The Dream</name>:&#8212; </p>

                <p xml:id="chap29-14"> This is very affectingly described; and his prose description bears
                    testimony to its correctness. <q>&#8220;It had been predicted by <persName>Mrs.

                        fortune-telling witch was right; it was destined to prove so. I shall never forget the 2d
                        of January, 1815, <persName key="LyByron">Lady Byron</persName> was the only unconcerned
                        person present; <persName key="JuMilba1822">Lady Noel</persName>, her mother, cried; I
                        trembled like a leaf, made the wrong responses, and after the ceremony called her

                    <q> &#8220;There is a singular history attached to the ring. The very day the match was
                        concluded a ring of my <pb xml:id="JG.192"/> mother&#8217;s, that had been lost, was dug up
                        by the gardener at Newstead. I thought it was sent on purpose for the wedding; but my
                        mother&#8217;s marriage had not been a fortunate one, and this ring was doomed to be the
                        seal of an unhappier union still. </q>
                </p>

                <p xml:id="chap29-16">
                    <q> &#8220;After the ordeal was over, we set off for a country-scat of <persName
                            key="RaMilba1825">Sir Ralph&#8217;s</persName> (Lady B.&#8217;s father), and I was
                        surprised at the arrangements for the journey, and somewhat out of humour, to find the
                        lady&#8217;s maid stuck between me and my bride. It was rather too early to assume the
                        husband; so I was forced to submit, but it was not with a very good grace. I have been
                        accused of saying, on getting into the carriage, that I had married <persName key="LyByron"
                            >Lady Byron</persName> out of spite, and because she had refused me twice. Though I was
                        for a moment vexed at her prudery, or whatever you may choose to call it, if I had made so
                        uncavalier, not to say brutal, a speech, I am convinced <persName>Lady Byron</persName>
                        would instantly have left the carriage to me and the maid. She had spirit enough to have
                        done so, and would properly have resented the affront. Our honeymoon was not all sunshine;
                        it had its clouds. </q>

                <p xml:id="chap29-17">
                    <q> &#8220;I was not so young when my <persName key="JoByron1791">father</persName> died, but
                        that I perfectly remember him, and had a very early horror of matrimony from the sight of
                        domestic broils: this feeling came over me very strongly at my wedding. Something whispered
                        me that I was sealing my own death-warrant. I am a great believer in presentiments:
                            <persName key="Socra399">Socrates&#8217;s</persName> demon was not a fiction; <persName
                            key="MaLewis1818">Monk Lewis</persName> had his monitor, and <persName key="Napoleon1"
                            >Napoleon</persName> many warnings. At the last moment I would have retreated, could I
                        have done so; I called to mind a friend of mine, who had married a young, beautiful, and
                        rich girl, and yet was miserable; he had strongly urged me against putting my neck in the
                        same yoke.&#8221; </q>

                <p xml:id="chap29-18"> For some time after the marriage things went on in the usual matrimonial
                    routine, until he was chosen into the managing committee of Drury Lane; an office <pb
                        xml:id="JG.193"/> in which, had he possessed the slightest degree of talent for business,
                    he might have done much good. It was justly expected that the illiterate presumption which had
                    so long deterred poetical genius from approaching the stage, would have shrunk abashed from
                    before him; but he either felt not the importance of the duty he had been called to perform,
                    or, what is more probable, yielding to the allurements of the moment, forgot that duty, in the
                    amusement which he derived from the talents and peculiarities of the players. No situation
                    could be more unfit for a man of his temperament, than one which exposed him to form intimacies
                    with persons whose profession, almost necessarily, leads them to undervalue the domestic
                    virtues. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap29-19"> It is said, that the course of life into which he was drawn after he joined
                    the managing committee of Drury Lane was not in unison with the methodical habits of <persName
                        key="LyByron">Lady Byron</persName>. But independently of outdoor causes of connubial
                    discontent and incompatibility of temper, their domestic affairs were falling into confusion. </p>

                    <q> &#8220;My income at this period,&#8221; says <persName key="LdByron">Lord Byron</persName>,
                        &#8220;was small, and somewhat bespoken. We had a house in town, gave dinner-parties, had
                        separate carriages, and launched into every sort of extravagance. This could not last long;
                        my wife&#8217;s ten thousand pounds soon melted away. I was beset by duns, and at length an
                        execution was levied, and the bailiffs put in possession of the very beds we had to sleep
                        on. This was no very agreeable state of affairs, no very pleasant scene for <persName
                            key="LyByron">Lady Byron</persName> to witness; and it was agreed she should pay her
                        father a visit till the storm had blown over, and some arrangement had been made with my
                        creditors.&#8221; From this visit her Ladyship never returned; a separation took place; but
                        too much has been said to the world respecting it, and I have no taste for the subject.
                        Whatever <pb xml:id="JG.194"/> was the immediate cause, the event itself was not of so rare
                        a kind as to deserve that the attention of the public should be indelicately courted to it.
                    </q>
                </p>

                <p xml:id="chap29-21"> Beyond all question, however, <persName key="LdByron">Lord
                        Byron&#8217;s</persName> notions of connubial obligations were rather philosophical.
                    &#8220;There are,&#8221; said he to <persName key="WiParry1859">Captain Parry</persName>,
                        <q>&#8220;so many undefinable and nameless, and not to be named, causes of dislike,
                        aversion, and disgust in the matrimonial state, that it is always impossible for the
                        public, or the friends of the parties, to judge between man and wife. Theirs is a relation
                        about which nobody but themselves can form a correct idea, or have any right to speak. As
                        long as neither party commits gross injustice towards the other; as long as neither the
                        woman nor the man is guilty of any offence which is injurious to the community; as long as
                        the husband provides for his offspring, and secures the public against the dangers arising
                        from their neglected education, or from the charge of supporting them; by what right does
                        it censure him for ceasing to dwell under the same roof with a woman, who is to him,
                        because he knows her, while others do not, an object of loathing? Can anything be more
                        monstrous, than for the public voice to compel individuals who dislike each other to
                        continue their cohabitation? This is at least the effect of its interfering with a
                        relationship, of which it has no possible means of judging. It does not indeed drag a man
                        to a woman&#8217;s bed by physical force, but it does exert a moral force continually and
                        effectively to accomplish the same purpose. Nobody can escape this force, but those who are
                        too high or those who are too low for public opinion to reach; or those hypocrites who are,
                        before others, the loudest in their approbation of the empty and unmeaning forms of
                        society, that they may securely indulge all their propensities in secret.&#8221;</q>
                </p>

                <p xml:id="chap29-22"> In the course of the conversation, in which he is represented to have stated
                    these opinions, he added <pb xml:id="JG.195"/> what I have pleasure in quoting, because the
                    sentiments are generous in respect to his wife, and strikingly characteristic of
                    himself:&#8212; </p>

                        religious opinions: and I wish when I married her that I had possessed the same command
                        over myself that I now do. Had I possessed a little more wisdom and more forbearance, we
                        might have been happy. I wished, when I was just married to have remained in the country,
                        particularly till my pecuniary embarrassments were over. I knew the society of London; I
                        knew the characters of many who are called ladies, with whom <persName>Lady
                            Byron</persName> would necessarily have to associate, and I dreaded her contact with
                        them. But I have too much of my mother about me to be dictated to; I like freedom from
                        constraint; I hate artificial regulations: my conduct has always been dictated by my own
                        feelings, and <persName>Lady Byron</persName> was quite the creature of rules. She was not
                        permitted either to ride, or run, or walk, but as the physician prescribed. She was not
                        suffered to go out when I wished to go: and then the old house was a mere ghost-house, I
                        dreamed of ghosts and thought of them waking. It was an existence I could not
                        support.&#8221; Here <persName key="LdByron">Lord Byron</persName> broke off abruptly,
                        saying, &#8220;I hate to speak of my family affairs, though I have been compelled to talk
                        nonsense concerning them to some of my butterfly visitors, glad on any terms to get rid of
                        their importunities. I long to be again on the mountains. I am fond of solitude, and should
                        never talk nonsense, if I always found plain men to talk to.&#8221; </q>

                    <hi rend="small-caps">The</hi> task just concluded may disappoint the expectations of some of
                    my readers, but I would rather have said less than so much, could so little have been allowed;
                    for I have never been able to reconcile to my notions of propriety, the exposure of domestic
                    concerns which the world has no right claim to know, and can only urge the plea of curiosity
                    for desiring to see explained. The scope of my undertaking comprehends only the public and
                    intellectual character of <persName key="LdByron">Lord Byron</persName>; every word that I have
                    found it necessary to say respecting his private affairs has been set down with reluctance; nor
                    should I have touched so freely on his failings, but that the consequences have deeply
                    influenced his poetical conceptions. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap30-2"> There is, however, one point connected with his conjugal differences which
                    cannot be overlooked, nor noticed without animadversion. He was too active himself in
                    bespeaking the public sympathy against his lady. It is true that but for that error the world
                    might never have seen the verses written by him on the occasion; and perhaps it was the friends
                    who were about him at the time who ought chiefly to be blamed for having given them
                    circulation: but in saying this, I am departing from the rule I had prescribed to myself, while
                    I ought only to have remarked that the <pb xml:id="JG.197"/> compositions alluded to, both the
                        <name type="title" key="LdByron.Farewell">Fare-thee-well</name> and the <name type="title"
                        key="LdByron.Sketch">Anathema on Mrs. Charlemont</name>, are splendid corroborations of the
                    metaphysical fact which it is the main object of this work to illustrate, namely, that
                        <persName key="LdByron">Byron</persName> was only original and truly great when he wrote
                    from the dictates of his own breast, and described from the suggestions of things he had seen.
                    When his imagination found not in his subject uses for the materials of his experience, and
                    opportunities to embody them, it seemed to be no longer the same high and mysterious faculty
                    that so ruled the tides of the feelings of others. He then appeared a more ordinary
                    poet&#8212;a skilful verse-maker. The necromancy which held the reader spellbound became
                    ineffectual; and the charm and the glory which interested so intensely, and shone so radiantly
                    on his configurations from realities, all failed and faded; for his genius dealt not with airy
                    fancies, but had its power and dominion amid the living and the local of the actual world. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap30-3"> I shall now return to the consideration of his works, and the first in order
                    is <name type="title" key="LdByron.Corsair">The Corsair</name>, published in 1814. He seems to
                    have been perfectly sensible that this beautiful composition was in his best peculiar manner.
                    It is indeed a pirate&#8217;s isle, peopled with his own creatures. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap30-4"> It has been alleged that <persName key="LdByron">Lord Byron</persName> was
                    indebted to <persName key="WaScott">Sir Walter Scott&#8217;s</persName> poem of <name
                        type="title" key="WaScott.Rokeby">Rokeby</name> for the leading incidents of <name
                        type="title" key="LdByron.Corsair">The Corsair</name>, but the resemblance is not to me
                    very obvious: besides, the whole style of the poem is so strikingly in his own manner, that
                    even had he borrowed the plan, it was only as a thread to string his own original conceptions
                    upon; the beauty and brilliancy of them could not be borrowed, and are not imitations. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap30-5"> There were two islands in the Archipelago, when <persName key="LdByron">Lord
                        Byron</persName> was in Greece, considered as the chief haunts of the pirates, Stampalia,
                    and a long narrow island between Cape Colonna and Zea. Jura also <pb xml:id="JG.198"/> was a
                    little tainted in its reputation. I think, however, from the description, that the
                    pirate&#8217;s isle of <name type="title" key="LdByron.Corsair">The Corsair</name> is the
                    island off Cape Colonna. It is a rude, rocky mass. I know not to what particular Coron, if
                    there be more than one, the poet alludes; for the Coron of the Morea is neighbour to, if not
                    in, the Mainote territory, a tract of country which never submitted to the Turks, and was
                    exempted from the jurisdiction of Mussulman officers by the payment of an annual tribute. The
                    Mainotes themselves are all pirates and robbers. If it be in that Coron that
                        <persName>Byron</persName> has placed <persName type="fiction">Seyd</persName> the pashaw,
                    it must be attributed to inadvertency. His Lordship was never there, nor in any part of Maina;
                    nor does he describe the place, a circumstance which of itself goes far to prove the
                    inadvertency. It is, however, only in making it the seat of a Turkish pashaw that any error has
                    been committed. In working out the incidents of the poem where descriptions of scenery are
                    given, they relate chiefly to Athens and its neighbourhood. In themselves these descriptions
                    are executed with an exquisite felicity; but they are brought in without any obvious reason
                    wherefore. In fact, they appear to have been written independently of the poem, and are patched
                    on &#8220;shreds of purple&#8221; which could have been spared. </p>

                    finely imagined; as the painters would say, it is in the highest style of art, and brought out
                    with sublime effect; but still it is only another phase of the same portentous meteor, that was
                    nebulous in <name type="title" key="LdByron.Harold">Childe Harold</name>, and fiery in <name
                        type="title" key="LdByron.Giaour">The Giaour</name>. To the safe and shop-resorting
                    inhabitants of Christendom, <name type="title" key="LdByron.Corsair">The Corsair</name> seems
                    to present many improbabilities; nevertheless, it is true to nature, and in every part of the
                    Levant the traveller meets with individuals whose air and physiognomy remind him of <persName
                        type="fiction">Conrad</persName>. The incidents of the story, also, so wild and extravagant
                    to the snug and legal notions of England, are not more in keeping with the character, than they
                    are in accordance with fact and reality. The poet suffers immeasurable injustice, when it is
                    attempted to determine the probability of the wild scenes and wilder adventurers of his tales,
                    by the circumstances and characters of the law-regulated system of our diurnal affairs.
                    Probability is a standard formed by experience, and it is not surprising that the anchorets of
                    libraries should object to the improbability of <name type="title">The Corsair</name>, and yet
                    acknowledge the poetical power displayed in the composition; for it is a work which could only
                    have been written by one who had himself seen or heard on the spot of transactions similar to
                    those he has described. No course of reading could have supplied materials for a narration so
                    faithfully descriptive of the accidents to which an &#198;gean pirate <pb xml:id="JG.201"/> is
                    exposed as <name type="title">The Corsair</name>. Had <persName key="LdByron">Lord
                        Byron</persName> never been out of England, the production of a work so appropriate in
                    reflection, so wild in spirit, and so bold in invention, as in that case it would have been,
                    would have entitled him to the highest honours of original conception, or been rejected as
                    extravagant; considered as the result of things seen, and of probabilities suggested, by
                    transactions not uncommon in the region where his genius gathered the ingredients of its
                    sorceries, more than the half of its merits disappear, while the other half brighten with the
                    lustre of truth. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap30-9"> The manners, the actions, and the incidents were new to the English mind; but
                    to the inhabitant of the Levant they have long been familiar, and the traveller who visits that
                    region will hesitate to admit that <persName key="LdByron">Lord Byron</persName> possessed
                    those creative powers, and that discernment of dark bosoms for which he is so much celebrated;
                    because he will see there how little of invention was necessary to form such heroes as
                        <persName type="fiction">Conrad</persName>, and how much the actual traffic of life and
                    trade is constantly stimulating enterprise and bravery. But let it not, therefore, be supposed,
                    that I would undervalue either the genius of the poet, or the merits of the poem, in saying so,
                    for I do think a higher faculty has been exerted in <name type="title" key="LdByron.Corsair"
                        >The Corsair</name> than in <name type="title" key="LdByron.Harold">Childe Harold</name>.
                    In the latter, only actual things are described, freshly and vigorously as they were seen, and
                    feelings expressed eloquently as they were felt; but in the former, the talent of combination
                    has been splendidly employed. The one is a view from nature, the other is a composition both
                    from nature and from history. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap30-11"> That <persName key="LdByron">Byron</persName> wrote best when he wrote of
                    himself and of his own, has probably been already made sufficiently apparent. In this respect
                    he stands alone and apart from all other poets, and there will be occasion to show, that this
                    peculiarity extended much farther over all his works, than merely to those which may be said to
                    have required him to be thus personal. The great distinction, indeed, of his merit consists in
                    that singularity. <persName key="WiShake1616">Shakspeare</persName>, in drawing the materials
                    of his dramas from tales and history has, with wonderful art, given from his own invention and
                    imagination the fittest and most appropriate sentiments and language; and admiration at the
                    perfection with which he has accomplished this, can never be exhausted. The difference between
                        <persName>Byron</persName> and <persName>Shakspeare</persName> consists in the curious
                    accident, if it may be so called, by which the former was placed in circumstances which taught
                    him to feel in himself the very sentiments that he has ascribed to his characters.
                        <persName>Shakspeare</persName> created the feelings of his, and with such excellence, that
                    they are not only probable to the situations, but give to the personifications the
                    individuality of living persons. <persName>Byron&#8217;s</persName> are scarcely less so; but
                    with him there was no invention, only experience, and when he attempts to express more than he
                    has himself known, he is always comparatively feeble. </p>

                    <hi rend="small-caps">From</hi> different incidental expressions in his correspondence it is
                    sufficiently evident that <persName key="LdByron">Byron</persName>, before his marriage,
                    intended to reside abroad. In his letter to me of the 11th December, 1813, he distinctly states
                    this intention, and intimates that he then thought of establishing his home in Greece. It is
                    not therefore surprising that, after his separation from <persName key="LyByron">Lady
                        Byron</persName>, he should have determined to carry this intention into effect; for at
                    that period, besides the calumny heaped upon him from all quarters, the embarrassment of his
                    affairs, and the retaliatory satire, all tended to force him into exile; he had no longer any
                    particular tie to bind him to England. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap31-2"> On the 25th of April, 1816, he sailed for Ostend, and resumed the composition
                    of <name type="title" key="LdByron.Harold">Childe Harold</name>, it may be said, from the
                    moment of his embarkation. In it, however, there is no longer the fiction of an imaginary
                    character stalking like a shadow amid his descriptions and reflections&#8212;he comes more
                    decidedly forward as the hero in his own person. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap31-3"> In passing to Brussels he visited the field of Waterloo, and the slight
                    sketch which he has given in the poem of that eventful conflict is still the finest which has
                    yet been written on the subject. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap31-4"> But the note of his visit to the field is of more importance to my present
                    purpose, inasmuch as it tends <pb xml:id="JG.205"/> to illustrate the querulous state of his
                    own mind at the time. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap31-5">
                    <q> &#8220;I went on horseback twice over the field, comparing it with my recollection of
                        similar scenes. As a plain, Waterloo seems marked out for the scene of some great action,
                        though this may be mere imagination. I have viewed with attention those of Platea, Troy,
                        Mantinea, Leuctra, Ch&#230;vronea, and Marathon, and the field round Mont St. Jean and
                        Hugoumont appears to want little but a better cause and that indefinable but impressive
                        halo which the lapse of ages throws around a celebrated spot, to vie in interest with any
                        or all of these, except perhaps the last-mentioned.&#8221; </q>
                </p>

                <p xml:id="chap31-6"> The expression &#8220;a better cause,&#8221; could only have been engendered
                    in mere waywardness; but throughout his reflections at this period a peevish ill-will towards
                    England is often manifested, as if he sought to attract attention by exasperating the national
                    pride; that pride which he secretly flattered himself was to be augmented by his own fame. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap31-7"> I cannot, in tracing his travels through the third canto, test the accuracy
                    of his descriptions as in the former two; but as they are all drawn from actual views they have

                <p xml:id="chap31-9"> But the most remarkable quality in the third canto is the deep, low bass of
                    thought which runs through several passages, and which gives to it, when considered with
                    reference to the circumstances under which it was written, the serious character of documentary
                    evidence as to the remorseful condition of the poet&#8217;s mind. It would be, after what has
                    already been pointed out in brighter incidents, affectation not to say, that these sad bursts
                    of feeling and wild paroxysms, bear strong indications of having been suggested by the wreck of
                    his domestic happiness, and dictated by contrition for the part he had himself taken in the

                    penned these remarkable lines; but independently of their striking beauty, the scenery in which
                    they were conceived deserves to be considered with reference to the sentiment that pervades
                    them. For it was amid the same obscure ravines, pine-tufted precipices and falling waters of
                    the Alps, that he afterward placed the outcast <persName type="fiction"

                    ventured to offer, in adverting to his ruminations in contemplating, while yet a boy, the
                    Malvern hills, as if they were the scenes of his impassioned childhood. In <q>&#8220;the
                        palaces of nature,&#8221;</q> he first felt the consciousness of having done some wrong,
                    and when he would infuse into another, albeit in a wilder degree, the feelings he had himself
                    felt, he recalled the images which had ministered to the cogitations of his own contrition. But
                    I shall have occasion to speak more of this, when I come to consider the nature of the guilt

                    with the satanic grandeur of the <name type="title" key="JoMilto1674.Paradise">Paradise
                        Lost</name>, and the hero is placed in circumstances, and amid scenes, which accord with
                    the stupendous features of his preternatural character. How then, it may be asked, does this
                    moral phantom, that has never been, bear any resemblance to the poet himself? Must not, in this
                    instance, the hypothesis which assigns to <persName>Byron&#8217;s</persName> heroes his own
                    sentiments and feelings be abandoned? I think not. In noticing the deep and solemn reflections
                    with which he was affected <pb xml:id="JG.209"/> in ascending the Rhine, and which he has
                    embodied in the third canto of <name type="title" key="LdByron.Harold">Childe Harold</name>, I
                    have already pointed out a similarity in the tenour of the thoughts to those of <persName
                        type="fiction">Manfred</persName>, as well as the striking acknowledgment of the
                    &#8220;filed&#8221; mind. There is, moreover, in the drama, the same distaste of the world
                    which <persName>Byron</persName> himself expressed when cogitating on the desolation of his
                    hearth, and the same contempt of the insufficiency of his genius and renown to mitigate
                    contrition&#8212;all in strange harmony with the same magnificent objects of sight. Is not the
                    opening soliloquy of <persName type="fiction">Manfred</persName> the very echo of the
                    reflections on the Rhine? </p>

                    manner in which <persName key="LdByron">Lord Byron</persName> spent his time in Switzerland,
                    has the raciness of his Lordship&#8217;s own quaintness, somewhat dilated. The reality of the
                    conversations I have heard questioned, but they relate in some instances to matters not
                    generally known, to the truth of several of which I can myself bear witness; moreover they have
                    much of the poet&#8217;s peculiar modes of thinking about them, though weakened in effect by
                    the reporter. No man can give a just representation of another who is not capable of putting
                    himself into the character of his original, and of thinking with his power and intelligence.
                    Still there are occasional touches of merit in the feeble outlines of <persName>Captain
                        Medwin</persName>, and with this conviction it would be negligence not to avail myself of

                        with seeing once; Turkey I could live in for ever. I never forget my predilections: I was
                        in a wretched state of health and worse spirits when I was at Geneva; but quiet and the
                        lake, better physicians than <persName key="JoPolid1821">Polidori</persName>, soon set me
                        up. I never led so moral a life as during my residence in that country; but I gained no
                        credit by it. Where there is mortification there ought to be reward. On the contrary, there
                        is no story so absurd that they did not <pb xml:id="JG.212"/> invent at my cost. I was
                        watched by glasses on the opposite side of the lake, and by glasses, too, that must have
                        had very distorted optics; I was waylaid in my evening drives. I believe they looked upon
                        me as a man-monster. </q>

                        edge: landed at Newhouse; passed Interlachen; entered upon a range of scenes beyond all

                        murdered the other; just the place for it. After a variety of windings, came to an enormous
                        rock; arrived at the foot of <pb xml:id="JG.213"/> the mountain (the Jungfrau) glaciers;
                        torrents, one of these nine hundred feet, visible descent; lodge at the curate&#8217;s; set
                        out to see the valley; heard an avalanche fall like thunder; glaciers; enormous storm comes
                        on thunder and lightning and hail, all in perfection and beautiful. The torrent is in
                        shape, curving over the rock, like the tail of the white horse streaming in the wind, just
                        as might be conceived would be that of the pale horse on which Death is mounted in the
                        Apocalypse: it is neither mist nor water, but a something between both; its immense height
                        gives a wave, a curve, a spreading here, a condensation there, wonderful, indescribable!

                        perpendicular precipices like the foam of the ocean of hell during a spring-tide. It was
                        white and sulphury, and immeasurably deep in appearance; the side we ascended was of course
                        not of so precipitous a nature; but on arriving at the summit, we looked down on the other
                        side upon a boiling sea of cloud dashing against the crag on which we stood. Arrived at the
                        Greenderwold, mounted and rode to the higher glacier, twilight, but distinct, very fine;
                        glacier like a frozen hurricane; starlight beautiful; the whole of the day was fine, and,

                    that knowledge has only brought him sorrow. They tell him he is immortal, and what he suffers
                    is as inextinguishable as his own being: why should he desire forgetfulness?&#8212;Has he not
                    committed a great secret sin? What is it?&#8212;He alludes to his sister, and in his subsequent
                    interview with the witch we gather a dreadful meaning concerning her fate. Her blood has been
                    shed, not by his hand nor in punishment, but in the shadow and occultations of some unutterable
                    crime and mystery. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap32-13"> There is in this little scene, perhaps, the deepest pathos ever expressed;
                    but it is not of its beauty that I am treating; my object in noticing it here is, that it may
                    be considered in connection with that where Manfred appears with his insatiate thirst of
                    knowledge, and manacled with guilt. It indicates that his sister, <pb xml:id="JG.217"/>
                    <persName type="fiction">Astarte</persName>, had been self-sacrificed in the pursuit of their
                    magical knowledge. Human sacrifices were supposed to be among the initiate propitiations of the
                    demons that have their purposes in magic&#8212;as well as compacts signed with the blood of the
                    self-sold. There was also a dark Egyptian art, of which the knowledge and the efficacy could
                    only be obtained by the novitiate&#8217;s procuring a voluntary victim&#8212;the dearest object
                    to himself and to whom he also was the dearest;* and the primary spring of <persName
                        key="LdByron">Byron&#8217;s</persName> tragedy lies, I conceive, in a sacrifice of that
                    kind having been performed, without obtaining that happiness which the votary expected would be
                    found in the knowledge and power purchased at such a price. His sister was sacrificed in vain.
                    The manner of the sacrifice is not divulged, but it is darkly intimated to have been done amid
                    the perturbations of something horrible. </p>

                <note place="foot">
                    <p xml:id="JG.217-n1"> * The sacrifice of <persName key="Antin130">Antinous</persName> by the
                        emperor <persName key="PuHadri">Adrian</persName> is supposed to have been a sacrifice of
                        that kind. <persName key="DiCassi150">Dion Cassius</persName> says that
                            <persName>Adrian</persName>, who had applied himself to the study of magic, being
                        deceived by the principles of that black Egyptian art into a belief that he would be
                        rendered immortal by a voluntary human sacrifice to the infernal gods, accepted the offer
                        which <persName>Antinous</persName> made of himself. </p>
                    <p xml:id="JG.217-n2"> I have somewhere met with a commentary on this to the following effect: </p>
                    <p xml:id="JG.217-n3"> The Christian religion, in the time of <persName key="PuHadri"
                            >Adrian</persName>, was rapidly spreading throughout the empire, and the doctrine of
                        gaining eternal life by the expiatory offering was openly preached. The Egyptian priests
                        who pretended to be in possession of all knowledge, affected to be acquainted with this
                        mystery also. The emperor was, by his taste and his vices, attached to the old religion;
                        but he trembled at the truths disclosed by the revelation; and in this state of
                        apprehension his thirst of knowledge and his fears led him to consult the priests of
                            <persName type="fiction">Osiris</persName> and <persName type="fiction"
                        >Isis</persName>; and they impressed him with a notion that the infernal deities would be
                        appeased by the sacrifice of a human being dear to him, and who loved him so entirely as to
                        lay down his life for him. <persName key="Antin130">Antinous</persName> moved by the
                        anxiety of his imperial master, when all others had refused, consented to sacrifice
                        himself; and it was for this devotion that <persName>Adrian</persName> caused his memory to
                        be hallowed with religious rites. </p>

                    afforded no asylum to a haunted heart; he was ill at ease with himself, even dissatisfied that
                    the world had not done him enough of wrong to justify his misanthropy. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap33-2"> Some expectation that his <persName key="LyByron">lady</persName> would
                    repent of her part in the separation probably induced him to linger in the vicinity of Geneva,
                    the thoroughfare of the travelling English, whom he affected to shun. If it were so, he was
                    disappointed, and, his hopes being frustrated, he broke up the establishment he had formed
                    there and crossed the Alps. After visiting some of the celebrated scenes and places in the
                    north of Italy he passed on to Venice, where he domiciled himself for a time. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap33-3"> During his residence at Venice <persName key="LdByron">Lord Byron</persName>
                    avoided as much as possible any intercourse with his countrymen. This was perhaps in some
                    degree necessary, and it was natural in the state of his mind. He had become an object of great
                    public interest by his talents; the stories connected with his domestic troubles had also
                    increased his notoriety, and in such circumstances he could not but shrink from the inquisition
                    of mere curiosity. But there was an insolence in the tone with <pb xml:id="JG.220"/> which he
                    declares his <q>&#8220;utter abhorrence of any contact with the travelling English,&#8221;</q>
                    that can neither be commended for its spirit, nor palliated by any treatment he had suffered.
                    Like <persName type="fiction">Coriolanus</persName> he may have banished his country, but he
                    had not, like the Roman, received provocation: on the contrary, he had been the aggressor in
                    the feuds with his literary adversaries; and there was a serious accusation against his morals,
                    or at least his manners, in the circumstances under which <persName key="LyByron">Lady
                        Byron</persName> withdrew from his house. It was, however, his misfortune throughout life
                    to form a wrong estimate of himself in everything save in his poetical powers. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap33-4"> A life in Venice is more monotonous than in any other great city; but a man
                    of genius carries with him everywhere a charm, which secures to him both variety and enjoyment.
                        <persName key="LdByron">Lord Byron</persName> had scarcely taken up his abode in Venice,
                    when he began the fourth canto of <name type="title" key="LdByron.Harold">Childe Harold</name>,
                    which he published early in the following year, and dedicated to his indefatigable friend
                        <persName key="JoHobho1869">Mr. Hobhouse</persName> by an epistle dated on the anniversary
                    of his marriage, <persName>&#8220;the most unfortunate day,&#8221; as he says, &#8220;of his
                        past existence.&#8221;</persName>
                </p>

                <p xml:id="chap33-5"> In this canto he has indulged his excursive moralizing beyond even the wide
                    licence he took in the three preceding parts; but it bears the impression of more reading and
                    observation. Though not superior in poetical energy, it is yet a higher work than any of them,
                    and something of a more resolved and masculine spirit pervades the reflections, and endows, as
                    it were, with thought and enthusiasm the aspect of the things described. Of the merits of the
                    descriptions, as of real things, I am not qualified to judge: the transcripts from the tablets
                    of the author&#8217;s bosom he has himself assured us are faithful. </p>

                        difference, and the disappointment at finding it unavailing, so far crushed my efforts in
                        the composition, that I determined to abandon it altogether&#8212;and have done so.&#8221;

                    emphasis to those passages in which the poet speaks of his own feelings. That his mind was
                    jarred, and out of joint, there is too much reason to believe; but he had in some measure
                    overcome the misery that clung to him during the dismal time of his sojourn in Switzerland, and
                    the following passage, though breathing the sweet and melancholy spirit of dejection, possesses

                    instances of his generosity, or to conduct less pleasant to record. Enough has appeared to show
                    that he was neither deficient in warmth of heart nor in less amiable feelings; but, upon the
                    whole, it is not probable that either in his charities or his pleasures he was greatly
                    different from other young men, though he undoubtedly had a wayward delight in magnifying his
                    excesses, not in what was to his credit, like most men, but in what was calculated to do him no
                    honour. More notoriety has been given to an instance of lavish liberality at Venice, than the
                    case deserved, though it was unquestionably prompted by a charitable impulse. The house of a
                    shoemaker, near his Lordship&#8217;s residence, in St. Samuel, was burned to the ground, with
                    all it contained, by which the proprietor was reduced to indigence. <persName>Byron</persName>
                    not only caused a new but a superior house to be erected, and also presented the sufferer with
                    a sum of money equal in value to the whole of his stock in trade and furniture. I should
                    endanger my reputation for impartiality if I did not, as a fair set-off to this, also mention
                    that it is said he bought for five hundred crowns a baker&#8217;s wife. There might be charity
                    in this, too. </p>

                        city die daily, as she does,&#8221; said he, &#8220;is a sad contemplation. I sought to
                        distract my mind from a sense of her desolation and my own solitude, by plunging into a
                        vortex that was anything but pleasure. When one gets into a mill-stream, it is difficult to
                        swim against it, and keep out of the wheels.&#8221;</q> He became tired and disgusted with
                    the life he led at Venice, and was glad to turn his back on it. About the close of the year
                    1819 he accordingly removed to Ravenna; but before I proceed to speak of the works which he
                    composed at Ravenna, it is necessary to explain some particulars respecting a personal affair,
                    the influence of which on at least one of his productions is as striking as any of the many
                    instances already described upon others. I allude to the intimacy which he formed with the
                    young <persName key="TeGuicc1873">Countess Guiccioli</persName>. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap34-2"> This lady, at the age of sixteen, was married to the <persName

                    advanced in life. <q>&#8220;From the first,&#8221; said <persName>Lord Byron</persName>, in his

                        but young Italian women are not satisfied with good old men, and the venerable Count did
                        not object to her availing herself of the privileges of her country in selecting a
                        cicisbeo; <pb xml:id="JG.226"/> an Italian would have made it quite agreeable: indeed, for
                        some time he winked at our intimacy, but at length made an exception against me, as a
                        foreigner, a heretic, an Englishman, and, what was worse than all, a Liberal.</q>

                        maintenance on condition that she should reside under her father&#8217;s roof. All this was
                        not agreeable, and at length I was forced to smuggle her out of Ravenna, having discovered
                        a plot laid with the sanction of the <persName key="AnRusco1825">legate</persName>, for

                    languishing eyes; and her auburn hair fell in great profusion of natural ringlets over her
                    shapely shoulders. Her features were not so regular as in their expression pleasing, and there
                    was an amiable gentleness in her voice which was peculiarly interesting. <persName key="LeHunt"

                        was handsome and lady-like, with an agreeable manner, and a voice not partaking too much of
                        the Italian fervour to be gentle. She had just enough of it to give her speaking a
                        grace&#8212;none of her graces appeared entirely free from art; nor, on the other hand, did
                        they betray enough of it to give you an ill opinion of her sincerity and good-humour* * *.
                        Her hair was what the poet has described, or rather <hi rend="italic">blond</hi>, with an
                        inclination to yellow; a very fair and delicate yellow, at all events, and within the
                        limits of the poetical. She had regular features of the order properly called handsome, in
                        distinction to prettiness or piquancy; being well proportioned to one another, large,
                        rather than otherwise, but without coarseness, and more harmonious than interesting. Her
                        nose was the handsomest of the kind I ever saw; and I have known her both smile very
                        sweetly, and look intelligently, when <persName key="LdByron">Lord Byron</persName> has
                        said something kind to her. I should not say, however, that she was a very intelligent
                        person. Both her wisdom and her want of wisdom were on the side of her feelings, in which
                        there was doubtless mingled a good deal of the self-love natural to a flattered beauty.* *
                        * * In a word, <q>Madame Guiccioli</q> was a kind of buxom parlour-boarder, compressing
                        herself artificially into dignity and elegance, and fancying she walked, in the eyes of the
                        whole world, a heroine by the side of a poet. When I saw her at Monte Nero, near Leghorn,
                        she was in a state of excitement and exultation, and had really something of this look. At
                        that time, also, she looked no older than she was; in which respect, a rapid and very
                        singular change took place, to the surprise of everybody. In the course of a few months she
                        seemed to have lived as many years.&#8221; </q>

                        too much; possibly because she knows I am not fond of blues. To use an expression of

                    provision. He had promised, it was reported, to settle two thousand pounds on her, but he
                    forgot the intention, or died before it was carried into effect.* On her part, the estrangement
                    was of a different and curious kind&#8212;she had not come to hate him, but she told a lady,

                    life as to Ravenna. The peasantry he thought the best people in the world, and their women the
                    most beautiful. <q>&#8220;Those at Tivoli and Frescati,&#8221; said he, &#8220;are mere
                        Sabines, coarse creatures, compared to the Romagnese. You may talk of your English women;
                        and it is true, that out of one hundred Italian and English you will find thirty of the
                        latter handsome; but then there will be one Italian on the other side of the scale, who
                        will more than balance the deficit in numbers&#8212;one who, like the Florence <persName

                        also at Ravenna much education and liberality of thinking among the higher classes. The
                        climate is delightful. I was not broken in upon by society. Ravenna lies out of the way of
                        travellers. I was never tired of my rides in the pine forest: it breathes of the <name

                        I was popular with all the leaders of the constitutional party. They knew that I came from
                        a land of liberty, and wished well to their cause. I would have espoused it too, <pb

                        for I had been living two years at Venice, where many of the Ravennese have houses. I did
                        not, however, take part in their intrigues, nor join in their political coteries; but I had
                        a magazine of one hundred stand of arms in the house, when everything was ripe for

                        brother of the <persName key="TeGuicc1873">Countess Guiccioli</persName>), who took no part
                        in the affair, were included in it. They were exiled, and their possessions confiscated.
                        They knew that this must eventually drive me out of the country. I did not follow them
                        immediately: I was not to be bullied&#8212;I had myself fallen under the eye of the

                    deep impression on <persName key="LdByron">Lord Byron</persName>. The <persName
                        key="LuPinto1820">commandant</persName> of the place, who, though suspected of being
                    secretly a Carbonaro, was too powerful a man to be arrested, was assassinated opposite to his
                    residence. The measures adopted to screen the murderer proved, in the opinion of his Lordship,
                    that the assassination had taken place by order of the police, and that the spot where it was
                    perpetrated had been selected by choice. <persName>Byron</persName> at the moment had his foot
                    in the stirrup, and his horse started at the report of the shot. On looking round he saw a man
                    throw down a carbine and run away, and another stretched on the pavement near him. On hastening
                    to the spot, he found it was the commandant; a crowd collected, but no one offered any
                    assistance. His Lordship directed his servant to lift the bleeding body into the
                    palace&#8212;he assisted himself in the act, though it was represented to him that he might
                    incur the displeasure of the government&#8212;and the gentleman was already dead. His adjutant
                    followed the body into the house. <q>&#8220;I remember,&#8221; says his Lordship, &#8220;his
                        lamentation over him&#8212;<q>&#8217;Poor devil he would not have harmed a

                <p xml:id="chap35-9"> This drama, to be properly appreciated, both in its taste and feeling should
                    be considered as addressed to the Italians of the epoch at which it was written. Had it been
                    written in the Italian instead of the English language, and could have come out in any city of
                    Italy, the effect would have been prodigious. It is, indeed, a work not to be estimated by the
                    delineations <pb xml:id="JG.233"/> of character nor the force of passion expressed in it, but
                    altogether by the apt and searching sarcasm of the political allusions. Viewed with reference
                    to the time and place in which it was composed, it would probably deserve to be ranked as a
                    high and bold effort: simply as a drama, it may not be entitled to rank above tragedies of the
                    second or third class. But I mean not to set my opinion of this work against that of the
                    public, the English public; all I contend for is, that it possesses many passages of uncommon
                    beauty, and that its chief tragic merit consists in its political indignation; but above all,
                    that is another and a strong proof too, of what I have been endeavouring to show, that the
                    power of the poet consisted in giving vent to his own feelings, and not, like his great
                    brethren, or even his less, in the invention of situations or of appropriate sentiments. It is,
                    perhaps, as it stands, not fit to succeed in representation; but it is so rich in matter that
                    it would not be a difficult task to make out of little more than the third part a tragedy which
                    would not dishonour the English stage. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap35-10"> I have never been able to understand why it has been so often supposed that
                        <persName key="LdByron">Lord Byron</persName> was actuated in the composition of his
                    different works by any other motive than enjoyment: perhaps no poet had ever less of an
                    ulterior purpose in his mind during the fits of inspiration (for the epithet may be applied
                    correctly to him and to the moods in which he was accustomed to write) than this singular and
                    impassioned man. Those who imagine that he had any intention to impair the reverence due to
                    religion, or to weaken the hinges of moral action, give him credit for far more design and
                    prospective purpose than he possessed. They could have known nothing of the man, the main
                    defect of whose character, in relation to everything, was in having too little of the element
                    or principle of purpose. He was a thing of impulses, and to judge of what he either said or
                    did, as the results of prede-<pb xml:id="JG.234"/>termination, was not only to do the harshest
                    injustice, but to show a total ignorance of his character. His whole fault, the darkest course
                    of those flights and deviations from propriety which have drawn upon him the severest
                    animadversion, lay in the unbridled state of his impulses. He felt, but never reasoned. I am
                    led to make these observations by noticing the ungracious, or, more justly, the illiberal

                    general verse of the poem is as harsh and abrupt as the clink and clang of the cymbal;
                    moreover, even for a prophecy, it is too obscure, and though it possesses abstractedly too many
                    fine thoughts, and too much of the combustion of heroic passion to be regarded as a failure,
                    yet it will never be popular. It is a quarry, however, of very precious poetical expression. </p>

                    inharmoniously turned. Like all his other best performances, this rugged but masterly
                    composition draws its highest interest from himself and his own feelings, and can only be
                    rightly appreciated by observing how fitly many of the bitter breathings of <persName

                    been conceived in a happier mood than any of all his other works; for even while it inculcates
                    the dangers of voluptuous indulgence, it breathes the very essence of benevolence and
                    philosophy. Pleasure takes so much of the character of virtue in it, that but for the moral
                    taught by the consequences, enjoyment might be mistaken for duty. I have never been able to
                    satisfy myself in what the resemblance consists, but from the first reading it has always
                    appeared to me that there was some elegant similarity between the characters of <persName

                    which so much of glory is supposed to consist. They are both alike incapable of rousing

                    voluptuaries, the most philosophical of the licentious. The first he is undoubtedly, but he is
                    not licentious; and in omitting to make him so, the poet has prevented his readers from
                    disliking his character upon principle. It was a skilful stroke of art to do this; had it been
                    otherwise, and had there been no affection shown for the Ionian slave, <persName type="fiction"
                        >Sardanapalus</persName> would have engaged no sympathy. It is not, however, with respect

                    invested, that I have so particularly made it a subject of criticism; it was to point out how

                    royalty and his inclinations for pleasure, we have a vivid insight of the cogitation of the
                    poet, whether to take a part in the hazardous activity which they were preparing, or to remain
                    in the seclusion and festal repose of which he was then in possession. The Assyrian is as much

                    fine but irrelevant poetry and moral reflection has been profusely spread; but were the piece
                    adapted to the stage, these portions would of course be omitted, and the character denuded of
                    them would then more fully justify the idea which I have formed of it, than it may perhaps to
                    many readers do at present, hidden as it is, both in shape and contour, under an excess of

                    shade of change in her appearance, and her every moment of melancholy reminiscence; so that,
                    even though she might never have given expression to her sentiments, still such was her
                    situation, that it could not but furnish him with fit suggestions from which to fill up the
                    moral being of the Ionian slave. Were the character of <persName type="fiction"

                    detract from the value of the composition, a great deal would be found to lessen the merit of
                    the poet&#8217;s invention. He had with him the very <pb xml:id="JG.239"/> being in person whom
                    he has depicted in the drama, of dispositions and endowments greatly similar, and in
                    circumstances in which she could not but feel as <persName type="fiction">Myrrha</persName> is
                    supposed to have felt&#8212;and it must be admitted, that he has applied the good fortune of

                    conversations, reading, and occasionally writing, constituted the regular business of the day.
                    In the cool of the afternoon, he sometimes went out in his carriage, oftener on horseback, and
                    generally amused himself with pistol practice at a five-paul piece. He dined at half an hour
                    after sunset, and then drove to <persName key="RuGamba1846">Count Gamba&#8217;s</persName>,
                    where he passed several hours with the <persName key="TeGuicc1873">Countess
                        Guiccioli</persName>, who at that time still resided with her father. On his return he read
                    or wrote till the night was far spent, or rather till the morning was come again, sipping at
                    intervals spirits diluted with water, as medicine to counteract some nephritic disorder to
                    which he considered himself liable. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap37-7"> Notwithstanding the tranquillity of this course of life, he was accidentally
                    engaged in a transaction which threatened unpleasant consequences, and had a material effect on
                    his comfort. On the 21st of March, 1822, as he was returning from his usual ride, in company
                    with several of his friends, a <persName key="StMasi1822">hussar officer</persName>, at full
                    speed, dashed through the party, and violently jostled one of them. <persName key="LdByron"
                        >Lord Byron</persName>, with his characteristic impetuosity, instantly pushed forwards, and
                    the rest followed, and overtook the hussar. His Lordship inquired what he meant by the insult;
                    but for answer, received the grossest abuse: on which <pb xml:id="JG.245"/> he and one of his
                    companions gave their cards, and passed on. The officer followed, hallooing, and threatening
                    with his hand on his sabre. They were now near the Paggia gate. During this altercation, a
                    common artilleryman interfered, and called out to the hussar, <q>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you
                        arrest them?&#8212;command us to arrest them.&#8221;</q> Upon which the officer gave the
                    word to the guard at the gate. His Lordship, hearing the order, spurred his horse, and one of
                    his party doing the same, they succeeded in forcing their way through the soldiers, while the
                    gate was closed on the rest of the party, with whom an outrageous scuffle ensued. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap37-8">
                    <persName key="LdByron">Lord Byron</persName>, on reaching his palace, gave directions to
                    inform the police, and, not seeing his companions coming up, rode back towards the gate. On his
                    way the hussar met him, and said, <q>&#8220;Are you
                        satisfied?&#8221;</q>&#8212;<persName>&#8220;No: tell me your
                            name!&#8221;</persName>&#8212;<q>&#8220;<persName key="StMasi1822">Serjeant-major
                            Masi</persName>.&#8221;</q> One of his Lordship&#8217;s servants, who at this moment
                    joined them, seized the hussar&#8217;s horse by the bridle, but his master commanded him to let
                    it go. The hussar then spurred his horse through the crowd, which by this time had collected in
                    front of the Lanfranchi palace, and in the attempt was wounded by a pitchfork. Several of the
                    servants were arrested, and imprisoned: and, during the investigation of the affair before the
                    police, <persName>Lord Byron&#8217;s</persName> house was surrounded by the dragoons belonging
                    to <persName>Serjeant-major Masi&#8217;s</persName> troop, who threatened to force the doors.
                    The result upon these particulars was not just; all <persName>Lord Byron&#8217;s</persName>
                    Italian servants were banished from Pisa; and with them the father and brother of the <persName
                        key="TeGuicc1873">Guiccioli</persName>, who had no concern whatever in the affair.
                        <persName>Lord Byron</persName> himself was also advised to quit the town, and, as the
                    Countess accompanied her <persName key="RuGamba1846">father</persName>, he soon after joined
                    them at Leghorn, and passed six weeks at Monte Nero, a country house in the vicinity of that
                    city. </p>

                <pb xml:id="JG.246"/>

                <p xml:id="chap37-9"> It was during his Lordship&#8217;s residence at Monte Nero, that an event
                    took place&#8212;his junction with <persName key="LeHunt">Mr. Leigh Hunt</persName>&#8212;which
                    had some effect both on his literary and his moral reputation. Previous to his departure from
                    England, there had been some intercourse between them&#8212;<persName key="LdByron"
                        >Byron</persName> had been introduced by <persName key="ThMoore1852">Moore</persName> to
                        <persName>Hunt</persName>, when the latter was suffering imprisonment for the indiscretion
                    of his pen, and by his civility had encouraged him, perhaps, into some degree of forgetfulness
                    as to their respective situations in society.&#8212;<persName>Mr. Hunt</persName> at no period
                    of their acquaintance appears to have been sufficiently sensible that a man of positive rank
                    has it always in his power, without giving anything like such a degree of offence as may be
                    resented otherwise than by estrangement, to inflict mortification, and, in consequence,
                    presumed too much to an equality with his Lordship&#8212;at least this is the impression his
                    conduct made upon me, from the familiarity of his dedicatory epistle prefixed to <name
                        type="title" key="LeHunt.Rimini">Rimini</name> to their riding out at Pisa together dressed
                        alike&#8212;<q>&#8220;We had blue frock-coats, white waistcoats and trousers, and velvet
                        caps, a la <persName key="RaSanzi1520">Raphael</persName>, and cut a gallant
                        figure.&#8221;</q> I do not discover on the part of <persName>Lord Byron</persName>, that
                    his Lordship ever forgot his rank; nor was he a personage likely to do so; in saying,
                    therefore, that <persName>Mr. Hunt</persName> presumed upon his condescension, I judge entirely
                    by his own statement of facts. I am not undertaking a defence of his lordship, for the manner
                    in which he acted towards <persName>Mr. Hunt</persName>, because it appears to me to have been,
                    in many respects, mean; but I do think there was an original error, a misconception of himself
                    on the part of <persName>Mr. Hunt</persName>, that drew down about him a degree of humiliation
                    that he might, by more self-respect, have avoided. However, I shall endeavour to give as
                    correct a summary of the whole affair as the materials before me will justify. </p>

                            <p xml:id="chap37.1-1"> &#8220;Since I last wrote to you, I have been on a visit to
                                    <persName key="LdByron">Lord Byron</persName> at Ravenna. The result of this
                                visit was a determination on his part to come and live at Pisa, and I have taken
                                the finest palace on the Lung&#8217; Arno for him. But the material part of my
                                visit consists in a message which he desires me to give you, and which I think
                                ought to add to your determination&#8212;for such a one I hope you have
                                formed&#8212;of restoring your shattered health and spirits by a migration to these
                                    <q>&#8216;regions mild, of calm and serene air.&#8217;</q>
                            </p>

                            <p xml:id="chap37.1-2"> &#8220;He proposes that you should come, and go shares with him
                                and me in a <name type="title" key="Liberal1822">periodical work</name> to be
                                conducted here, in which each of the contracting parties should publish all their
                                original compositions, and share the profits. He proposed it to <persName
                                    key="ThMoore1852">Moore</persName>, but for some reason it was never brought to
                                bear. There can be no doubt that the profits of any scheme in which you and
                                    <persName key="LdByron">Lord Byron</persName> engage must, for various yet
                                co-operating reasons, be very great. As to myself, I am, for the present, only a
                                sort of link between you and him, until you can know each other, and effectuate the
                                arrangement; since (to intrust you with a secret, which for your sake I withhold
                                from <persName>Lord Byron</persName>) nothing would induce me to share in the
                                profits, and still less in the borrowed splendour of such a partnership. You and
                                he, in different manners, would be equal, and would bring in a different manner,
                                but in the same proportion, equal stocks of reputation and success. Do not let my
                                frankness with you, nor my belief that you deserve it more than <persName>Lord
                                    Byron</persName>, have the effect of deterring you from assuming a station in
                                modern literature, which the <pb xml:id="JG.248"/> universal voice of my
                                contemporaries forbids me either to stoop or aspire to. I am, and I desire to be,

                        >Lord Byron</persName>, and remitted to him. He reached Leghorn soon after his Lordship had
                    taken up his temporary residence at Monte Nero. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap38-2"> The meeting with his Lordship was in so many respects remarkable, that the
                    details of it cannot well be omitted. The day was very hot; and when <persName key="LeHunt"
                        >Hunt</persName> reached the house he found the hottest-looking habitation he had ever
                    seen. Not content with having a red wash over it, the red was the most unseasonable of all
                    reds&#8212;a salmon-colour; but the greatest of all heats was within. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap38-3">
                    <persName key="LdByron">Lord Byron</persName> was grown so fat that he scarcely knew him; and
                    was dressed in a loose nankeen jacket and white trousers, his neckcloth open, and his hair in
                    thin ringlets about his throat; altogether presenting a very different aspect from the compact,
                    energetic, and curly-headed person whom Hunt had known in England. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap38-4"> His Lordship took the stranger into an inner room, and introduced him to a
                    young lady who was in a <pb xml:id="JG.250"/> state of great agitation. This was the <persName
                        key="TeGuicc1873">Guiccioli</persName>; presently her brother also, in great agitation,
                    entered, having his arm in a sling. This scene and confusion had arisen from a quarrel among
                    the servants, in which the <persName key="PiGamba1827">young Count</persName>, having
                    interfered, had been stabbed. He was very angry, the Countess was more so, and would not listen
                    to the comments of <persName key="LdByron">Lord Byron</persName>, who was for making light of
                    the matter. Indeed, it looked somewhat serious, for though the stab was not much, the inflicter
                    threatened more, and was at that time revengefully keeping watch, with knotted brows, under the
                    portico, with the avowed intention of assaulting the first person who issued forth. He was a
                    sinister-looking, meager caitiff, with a red cap&#8212;gaunt, ugly, and unshaven; his
                    appearance altogether more squalid and miserable than Englishmen would conceive it possible to
                    find in such an establishment. An end, however, was put to the tragedy by the fellow throwing
                    himself on a bench, and bursting into tears&#8212;wailing and asking pardon for his offence,
                    and perfecting his penitence by requesting <persName>Lord Byron</persName> to kiss him in token
                    of forgiveness. In the end, however, he was dismissed; and it being arranged that <persName
                        key="LeHunt">Mr. Hunt</persName> should move his family to apartments in the Lanfranchi
                    palace at Pisa, that gentleman returned to Leghorn. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap38-5"> The account which <persName key="LeHunt">Mr. Hunt</persName> has given, in
                    his memoir of <persName key="LdByron">Lord Byron</persName>, is evidently written under
                    offended feeling; and in consequence, though he does not appear to have been much indebted to
                    the munificence of his Lordship, the tendency is to make his readers sensible that he was, if
                    not ill used, disappointed. The Casa Lanfranchi was a huge and gaunt building, capable, without
                    inconvenience or intermixture, of accommodating several families. It was, therefore, not a
                    great favour in his Lordship, considering that he had invited <persName>Mr. Hunt</persName>
                    from England to <pb xml:id="JG.251"/> become a partner with him in a speculation purely
                    commercial, to permit him to occupy the ground-floor or flat, as it would be called in
                    Scotland. The apartments being empty, furniture was necessary, and the plainest was provided;
                    good of its kind and respectable, it yet could not have cost a great deal. It was chosen by
                        <persName key="PeShell1822">Mr. Shelley</persName>, who intended to make a present of it to
                        <persName>Mr. Hunt</persName>; but when the apartments were fitted up, <persName>Lord
                        Byron</persName> insisted upon paying the account, and to that extent <persName>Mr.
                        Hunt</persName> incurred a pecuniary obligation to his Lordship. The two hundred pounds
                    already mentioned was a debt to <persName>Mr. Shelley</persName>, who borrowed the money from
                        <persName>Lord Byron</persName>. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap38-6"> Soon after <persName key="LeHunt">Mr. Hunt&#8217;s</persName> family were
                    settled in their new lodgings, <persName key="PeShell1822">Shelley</persName> returned to
                    Leghorn, with the intention of taking a sea excursion&#8212;in the course of which he was lost:
                        <persName key="LdByron">Lord Byron</persName> knowing how much <persName>Hunt</persName>
                    was dependent on that gentleman, immediately offered him the command of his purse, and
                    requested to be considered as standing in the place of <persName>Shelley</persName>, his
                    particular friend. This was both gentlemanly and generous, and the offer was accepted, but with
                    feelings neither just nor gracious: <q>&#8220;Stern necessity and a large family compelled
                        me,&#8221; says <persName>Mr. Hunt</persName>, &#8220;and during our residence at Pisa I
                        had from him, or rather from his steward, to whom he always sent me for the money, and who
                        doled it out to me as if my disgraces were being counted, the sum of seventy
                        pounds.&#8221;</q>
                </p>

                <p xml:id="chap38-7">
                    <q>&#8220;This sum,&#8221; he adds, &#8220;together with the payment of our expenses when we
                        accompanied him from Pisa to Genoa, and thirty pounds with which he enabled us subsequently
                        to go from Genoa to Florence, was all the money I ever received from <persName
                            key="LdByron">Lord Byron</persName>, exclusive of the two hundred pounds, which, in the
                        first instance, he made a debt of <persName key="PeShell1822">Mr. Shelley</persName>, by
                        taking his bond.&#8221;</q>&#8212;The whole extent of the pecuniary obligation appears
                    certainly not to have exceeded five hundred pounds; no great sum&#8212;but little or great, the
                    manner in which <pb xml:id="JG.252"/> it was recollected reflects no credit either on the head
                    or heart of the debtor. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap38-8">
                    <persName key="LeHunt">Mr. Hunt</persName>, in extenuation of the bitterness with which he has
                    spoken on the subject, says, that <q>&#8220;<persName key="LdByron">Lord Byron</persName> made
                        no scruple of talking very freely of me and mine.&#8221;</q> It may, therefore, be
                    possible, that <persName>Mr. Hunt</persName> had cause for his resentment, and to feel the
                    humiliation of being under obligations to a mean man; at the same time <persName>Lord
                        Byron</persName>, on his side, may upon experience have found equal reason to repent of his
                    connection with <persName>Mr. Hunt</persName>. And it is certain that each has sought to
                    justify, both to himself and to the world, the rupture of a copartnery which ought never to
                    have been formed. But his Lordship&#8217;s conduct is the least justifiable. He had allured
                        <persName>Hunt</persName> to Italy with flattering hopes; he had a perfect knowledge of his
                    hampered circumstances, and he was thoroughly aware that, until their speculation became
                    productive, he must support him. To the extent of about five hundred pounds he did so: a
                    trifle, considering the glittering anticipations of their scheme. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap38-9"> Viewing their copartnery, however, as a mere commercial speculation, his
                    Lordship&#8217;s advance could not be regarded as liberal, and no modification of the term
                    munificence or patronage could be applied to it. But, unless he had harassed
                        <persName>Hunt</persName> for the repayment of the money, which does not appear to have
                    been the case, nor could he morally, perhaps even legally, have done so, that gentleman had no
                    cause to complain. The joint adventure was a failure, and except a little repining on the part
                    of the one for the loss of his advance, and of grudging on that of the other for the waste of
                    his time, no sharper feeling ought to have arisen between them. But vanity was mingled with
                    their golden dreams. <persName key="LdByron">Lord Byron</persName> mistook <persName
                        key="LeHunt">Hunt&#8217;s</persName> political notoriety for literary reputation, and
                        <persName>Mr. Hunt</persName> thought it was a fine thing to be chum and partner with so
                    renowned a lord. After all, however, the worst which can be said <pb xml:id="JG.253"/> of it
                    is, that formed in weakness it could produce only vexation. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap38-10"> But the dissolution of the vapour with which both parties were so
                    intoxicated, and which led to their quarrel, might have occasioned only amusement to the world,
                    had it not left an ignoble stigma on the character of <persName key="LdByron">Lord
                        Byron</persName>, and given cause to every admirer of his genius to deplore, that he should
                    have so forgotten his dignity and fame. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap38-11"> There is no disputing the fact, that his Lordship, in conceiving the plan of
                        <name type="title" key="Liberal1822">The Liberal</name>, was actuated by sordid motives,
                    and of the basest kind, inasmuch as it was intended that the popularity of the work should rest
                    upon satire; or, in other words, on the ability to be displayed by it in the art of detraction.
                    Being disappointed in his hopes of profit, he shuffled out of the concern as meanly as any
                    higgler could have done who had found himself in a profitless business with a disreputable
                    partner. There is no disguising this unvarnished truth; and though his friends did well in
                    getting the connection ended as quickly as possible, they could not eradicate the original sin
                    of the transaction, nor extinguish the consequences which it of necessity entailed. Let me not,
                    however, be misunderstood: my objection to the conduct of <persName key="LdByron"
                        >Byron</persName> does not lie against the wish to turn his extraordinary talents to
                    profitable account, but to the mode in which he proposed to, and did, employ them. Whether
                        <persName key="LeHunt">Mr. Hunt</persName> was or was not a fit copartner for one of his
                    Lordship&#8217;s rank and celebrity, I do not undertake to judge; but any individual was good
                    enough for that vile prostitution of his genius, to which, in an unguarded hour, he submitted
                    for money. Indeed, it would be doing injustice to compare the motives of <persName>Mr.
                        Hunt</persName> in the business with those by which <persName>Lord Byron</persName> was
                    infatuated. He put nothing to hazard; happen what might, he could not be otherwise than a
                    gainer; for if profit failed, it could not be denied that the &#8220;fore-<pb xml:id="JG.254"
                    />most&#8221; poet of all the age had discerned in him either the promise or the existence of
                    merit, which he was desirous of associating with his own. This advantage <persName>Mr.
                        Hunt</persName> did gain by the connection; and it is his own fault that he cannot be
                    recollected as the associate of <persName>Byron</persName>, but only as having attempted to
                    deface his monument. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap39-1">
                    <hi rend="small-caps">It</hi> has been my study in writing these sketches to introduce as few
                    names as the nature of the work would admit of; but <persName key="LdByron">Lord
                        Byron</persName> connected himself with persons who had claims to public consideration on
                    account of their talents; and, without affectation, it is not easy to avoid taking notice of
                    his intimacy with some of them, especially, if in the course of it any circumstance came to
                    pass which was in itself remarkable, or likely to have produced an impression on his
                    Lordship&#8217;s mind. His friendship with <persName key="PeShell1822">Mr. Shelley</persName>,
                    mentioned in the preceding chapter, was an instance of this kind. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap39-2"> That unfortunate gentleman was undoubtedly a man of genius&#8212;full of
                    ideal beauty and enthusiasm. And yet there was some defect in his understanding by which he
                    subjected himself to the accusation of atheism. In his dispositions he is represented to have
                    been ever calm and amiable; and but for his metaphysical errors and reveries, and a singular
                    incapability of conceiving the existing state of things as it practically affects the nature
                    and condition of man, to have possessed many of the gentlest qualities of humanity. He highly
                    admired the endowments of <persName key="LdByron">Lord Byron</persName>, and in return was
                    esteemed by his Lordship; but even had there been neither sympathy nor friend-<pb
                        xml:id="JG.256"/>ship between them, his premature fate could not but have saddened Byron
                    with no common sorrow. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap39-3">
                    <persName key="PeShell1822">Mr. Shelley</persName> was some years younger than his noble
                    friend; he was the eldest son of <persName key="TiShell1844">Sir Timothy Shelley</persName>,
                    Bart., of Castle Goring, Sussex. At the age of thirteen he was sent to Eton, where he rarely
                    mixed in the common amusements of the other boys; but was of a shy, reserved disposition, fond
                    of solitude, and made few friends. He was not distinguished for his proficiency in the regular
                    studies of the school; on the contrary, he neglected them for German and chemistry. His
                    abilities were superior, but deteriorated by eccentricity. At the age of sixteen he was sent to
                    the University of Oxford, where he soon distinguished himself by publishing a pamphlet, under
                    the absurd and world-defying title of <name type="title" key="PeShell1822.Necessity">The
                        Necessity of Atheism</name>; for which he was expelled from the University. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap39-4"> The event proved fatal to his prospects in life; and the treatment he
                    received from his family was too harsh to win him from error. His father, however, in a short
                    time relented, and he was received home; but he took so little trouble to conciliate the esteem
                    of his friends, that he found the house uncomfortable, and left it. He then went to London;
                    where he eloped with a <persName key="HaShell1816">young lady</persName> to Gretna Green. Their
                    united ages amounted to thirty-two; and the match being deemed unsuitable to his rank and
                    prospects, it so exasperated his father, that he broke off all communication with him. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap39-5"> After their marriage the young couple resided some time in Edinburgh. They
                    then passed over to Ireland, which being in a state of disturbance, <persName key="PeShell1822"
                        >Shelley</persName> took a part in politics, more reasonable than might have been expected.
                    He inculcated moderation. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap39-6"> About this tune he became devoted to the cultivation of his poetical talents;
                    but his works were sullied with the erroneous inductions of an understanding which, <pb
                        xml:id="JG.257"/> inasmuch as he regarded all the existing world in the wrong, must be
                    considered as having been either shattered or defective. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap39-7"> His rash marriage proved, of course, an unhappy one. After the birth of two
                    children, a separation, by mutual consent, took place, and <persName key="HaShell1816">Mrs.
                        Shelley</persName> committed suicide. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap39-8"> He then married a <persName key="MaShell1851">daughter</persName> of
                        <persName key="WiGodwi1836">Mr. Godwin</persName>, the author of <name type="title"
                        key="WiGodwi1836.Caleb">Caleb Williams</name>, and they resided for some time at Great
                    Marlow, in Buckinghamshire, much respected for their charity. In the meantime, his irreligious
                    opinions had attracted public notice, and, in consequence of his unsatisfactory notions of the
                    Deity, his children, probably at the instance of his father, were taken from him by a decree of
                    the <persName key="LdEldon1">Lord Chancellor</persName>: an event which, with increasing
                    pecuniary embarrassments, induced him to quit England, with the intention of never returning. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap39-9"> Being in Switzerland when <persName key="LdByron">Lord Byron</persName>,
                    after his domestic tribulations, arrived at Geneva, they became acquainted. He then crossed the
                    Alps, and again at Venice renewed his friendship with his Lordship; he thence passed to Rome,
                    where he resided some time; and after visiting Naples, fixed his permanent residence in
                    Tuscany. His acquirements were constantly augmenting, and he was without question an
                    accomplished person. He was, however, more of a metaphysician than a poet, though there are
                    splendid specimens of poetical thought in his works. As a man, he was objected to only on
                    account of his speculative opinions; for he possessed many amiable qualities, was just in his
                    intentions, and generous to excess. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap39-10"> When he had seen <persName key="LeHunt">Mr. Hunt</persName> established in
                    the Casa Lanfranchi with <persName key="LdByron">Lord Byron</persName> at Pisa, <persName
                        key="PeShell1822">Mr. Shelley</persName> returned to Leghorn, for the purpose of taking a
                    sea excursion; an amusement to which he was much <pb xml:id="JG.258"/> attached. During a
                    violent storm the boat was swamped, and the party on board were all drowned. Their bodies were,
                    however, afterwards cast on shore; <persName>Mr. Shelley&#8217;s</persName> was found near Via
                    Reggio, and, being greatly decomposed, and unfit to be removed, it was determined to reduce the
                    remains to ashes, that they might be carried to a place of sepulture. Accordingly preparations
                    were made for the burning. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap39-11"> Wood in abundance was found on the shore, consisting of old trees and the
                    wreck of vessels: the spot itself was well suited for the ceremony. The magnificent bay of
                    Spezzia was on the right, and Leghorn on the left, at equal distances of about two-and-twenty
                    miles. The headlands project boldly far into the sea; in front lie several islands, and behind
                    dark forests and the cliffy Apennines. Nothing was omitted that could exalt and dignify the
                    mournful rites with the associations of classic antiquity; frankincense and wine were not
                    forgotten. The weather was serene and beautiful, and the pacified ocean was silent, as the
                    flame rose with extraordinary brightness. <persName key="LdByron">Lord Byron</persName> was
                    present; but he should himself have described the scene and what he felt. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap39-12"> These antique obsequies were undoubtedly affecting; but the return of the
                    mourners from the burning is the most appalling orgia, without the horror of crime, of which I
                    have ever heard. When the duty was done, and the ashes collected, they dined and drank much
                    together, and bursting from the calm mastery with which they had repressed their feelings

                    shouted, and their barouche was driven like a whirlwind through the forest. I can conceive
                    nothing descriptive of the demoniac revelry of that flight, but scraps of the dead man&#8217;s

                    1815, <persName key="LdByron">Byron</persName> began a drama upon the same subject, and nearly
                    completed an act when he was interrupted. <q>&#8220;I have adopted,&#8221; he says himself,
                        &#8220;the characters, plan, and even the language of many parts of this story;&#8221;</q>
                    an acknowledgment which exempts it from that kind of criticism to which his principal works are
                    herein subjected. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap40-4"> But <name type="title" key="LdByron.Deformed">The Deformed
                    Transformed</name>, which was also written at Pisa, is, though confessedly an imitation of

                        key="JoGoeth1832.Faust">Faust</name>, substantially an original work. In the opinion of
                        <persName key="ThMoore1852">Mr. Moore</persName>, it probably owes something to the
                    author&#8217;s painful sensibility to the defect in his own foot; an accident which must, from
                    the acuteness with which he felt it, have essentially contributed to enable him to comprehend
                    and to express the envy of those afflicted with irremediable exceptions to the ordinary course
                    of fortune, or who have been amerced by nature of their fair proportions. But save only a part
                    of the first scene, the sketch will not rank among the felicitous works of the poet. It was
                    intended to be a satire&#8212;probably, at least&#8212;but it is only a fragment&#8212;a
                    failure. </p>

                        Juan</name> otherwise than incidentally. It was commenced in Venice, and afterward
                    continued at intervals to the end of the sixteenth canto, until the author left Pisa, when it
                    was not resumed, at least no more has been published. Strong objections have been made to its
                    moral tendency; but, in the opinion of many, it is the poet&#8217;s masterpiece, and
                    undoubtedly it displays all the variety of his powers, combined with a quaint playfulness not
                    found to an equal degree in any other of his works. The serious and pathetic portions are
                    exquisitely beautiful; the descriptive have all the distinctness of the best pictures in <name
                        type="title" key="LdByron.Harold">Childe Harold</name>, and are, moreover, generally drawn
                    from nature, while the satire is for the most part curiously associated and sparklingly witty.
                    The characters are sketched with amazing firmness and freedom, and though sometimes grotesque,
                    are yet not often overcharged. It is professedly an epic poem, but it may be more properly
                    described as a poetical novel. Nor can it be said to inculcate any particular moral, or to do
                    more than unmantle the decorum of society. Bold and buoyant throughout, it exhibits a free
                    irreverent knowledge of the world, laughing or mocking as the thought serves, in the most
                    unexpected antitheses to the proprieties of time, place, and circumstance. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap40-6"> The object of the poem is to describe the progress of a libertine through
                    life, not an unprincipled prodigal, whose profligacy, growing with his growth, and
                    strengthening with his strength, passes from voluptuous indulgence into the sordid sensuality
                    of systematic debauchery, but a young gentleman, who, whirled by the vigour and vivacity of his
                    animal spirits into a world of adventures, in which his stars are chiefly in fault for his
                    liaisons, settles at last into an honourable lawgiver, a moral speaker on divorce bills, and
                    possibly a subscriber to the Society for the Suppression of Vice. The author has not completed
                    his design, but such appears to have <pb xml:id="JG.264"/> been the drift of it, affording
                    ample opportunities to unveil the foibles and follies of all sorts of men&#8212;and women too.
                    It is generally supposed to contain much of the author&#8217;s own experience, but still, with
                    all its riant knowledge of bowers and boudoirs, it is deficient as a true limning of the world,
                    by showing man as if he were always ruled by one predominant appetite. </p>

                    England, a point the reader may determine for himself; while the vagueness of the parts derived
                    from books, or sketched from fancy, as contrasted with them, justifies the opinion, that
                    invention was not the most eminent faculty of <persName key="LdByron">Byron</persName>, either
                    in scenes or in characters. Of the demerits of the poem it is only necessary to remark, that it
                    has been proscribed on account of its immorality; perhaps, however, there was more of prudery
                    than of equity in the decision, at least it is liable to be so considered, so long as reprints
                    are permitted of the older dramatists, with all their unpruned licentiousness. </p>

                    more fatal to his reputation. Not only were the invidious eyes of bigotry now eagerly fixed
                    upon his conduct, but those of admiration were saddened and turned away from him. His
                    principles, which would have been more correctly designated as paradoxes, were objects of
                    jealousy to the Tuscan Government; and it has been already seen that there was a disorderliness
                    about the Casa Lanfranchi which attracted the attention of the police. His situation in Pisa
                    became, in consequence, irksome; and he resolved to remove to Genoa, an intention which he
                    carried into effect about the end of September, 1822, at which period his thoughts began to
                    gravitate towards Greece. Having attained to the summit of his literary eminence, he grew
                    ambitious of trying fortune in another field of adventure. </p>

                        >Guiccioli</persName> in Albaro, a pleasant village on a hill, in the vicinity of the city;
                    it was the Casa Saluzzi, and I have been told, that during the time he resided there, he seemed
                    to enjoy a more uniform and temperate gaiety than in any former period of his life. There might
                    have been less of sentiment in his felicity, than when he lived at Ravenna, as he seldom wrote
                    poetry, but he appeared to some of his occasional visitors, who knew him in London, to have
                    become more agreeable and manly. I may add, at the risk of sarcasm for the vanity, that in
                    proof of his mellowed temper towards me, besides the kind frankness with which he received my
                    friend, as already mentioned, he sent me word, by the <persName key="LdBless1">Earl of
                        Blesinton</persName>, that he had read my novel of <name type="title"

                    with. This was the more agreeable, as I had heard within the same week, that <persName
                        key="WaScott">Sir Walter Scott</persName> had done and said nearly the same thing. Half the
                    compliment from two such men would be something to be proud of. </p>

                    <persName key="LdByron">Lord Byron&#8217;s</persName> residence at Albaro was separate from <pb
                        xml:id="JG.269"/> that of <persName key="LeHunt">Mr. Hunt</persName>, and, in consequence,
                    they were more rarely together than when domiciled under the same roof as at Pisa. Indeed, by
                    this time, if one may take <persName>Mr. Hunt&#8217;s</persName> own account of the matter,
                    they appear to have become pretty well tired of each other. He had found out that a peer is, as
                    a friend, but as a plebeian, and a great poet not always a high-minded man. His Lordship had,
                    on his part, discovered that something more than smartness or ingenuity is necessary to protect
                    patronage from familiarity. Perhaps intimate acquaintance had also tended to enable him to
                    appreciate, with greater accuracy, the meretricious genius and artificial tastes of his
                    copartner in <name type="title" key="Liberal1822">The Liberal</name>. It is certain that he
                    laughed at his affected admiration of landscapes, and considered his descriptions of scenery as
                    drawn from pictures. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap41-3"> One day, as a friend of mine was conversing with his Lordship at the Casa
                    Saluzzi, on the moral impressions of magnificent scenery, he happened to remark that he thought
                    the view of the Alps in the evening, from Turin, the sublimest scene he had ever beheld.
                        <q>&#8220;It is impossible,&#8221; said he, &#8220;at such a time, when all the west is
                        golden and glowing behind them, to contemplate such vast masses of the Deity without being
                        awed into rest, and forgetting such things as man and his
                            follies.&#8221;</q>&#8212;<q>&#8220;<persName key="LeHunt">Hunt</persName>,&#8221; said
                        his Lordship, smiling, &#8220;has no perception of the sublimity of Alpine scenery; he
                        calls a mountain a great impostor.&#8221;</q>

                    something of its quality known. All his Lordship&#8217;s friends were disturbed at the idea of
                    the publication. They did not like the connection he had formed with <persName
                        key="PeShell1822">Mr Shelley</persName>&#8212;they liked still less the copartnery with

                    I have nothing to do. It is an historical fact that they existed, and became mo-<pb

                    soon after the copartnery had established themselves at Genoa, accompanied with hopes and
                    fears. Much good could not be anticipated from a work which outraged the loyal and decorous

                    The history of literature affords no instance of a condemnation less justifiable, on the plea
                    of profanity, than that of this Mystery. That it abounds in literary blemishes, both of plan
                    and language, and that there are harsh jangles and discords in the verse, is not disputed; but
                    still it abounds in a grave patriarchal spirit, and is echo to the oracles of
                        <persName>Adam</persName> and <persName>Melchisedek</persName>. It may not be worthy of
                        <persName>Lord Byron&#8217;s</persName> genius, but it does him no dishonour, and contains
                    passages which accord with the solemn diapasons of ancient devotion. The disgust which <name
                        type="title">The Vision of Judgment</name> had produced, rendered it easy to persuade the
                    world that there was impiety in the <name type="title">Heaven and Earth</name>, although, in
                    point of fact, it may be described as hallowed with the Scriptural theology of <persName
                        key="JoMilto1674">Milton</persName>. The objections to its literary defects were magnified
                    into sins against worship and religion. </p>

                    <name type="title" key="Liberal1822">The Liberal</name> stopped with the fourth number, I
                    believe. It disappointed not merely literary men in general, but even the most special admirers
                    of the talents of the contributors. The main defect of the work was a lack of knowledge.
                    Neither in style nor <pb xml:id="JG.271"/> genius, nor even in general ability, was it wanting;
                    but where it showed learning it was not of a kind in which the age took much interest.
                    Moreover, the manner and cast of thinking of all the writers in it were familiar to the public,
                    and they were too few in number to variegate their pages with sufficient novelty. But the main
                    cause of the failure was the antipathy formed and fostered against it before it appeared. It
                    was cried down, and it must be acknowledged that it did not much deserve a better fate. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap41-7"> With <name type="title" key="Liberal1822">The Liberal</name> I shall close my

                    voluminous to be examined even in the brief and sketchy manner in which I have considered those
                    which are deemed the principal. Besides, they are not, like them, all characteristic of the
                    author, though possessing great similarity in style and thought to one another. Nor would such
                    general criticism accord with the plan of this work. <persName>Lord Byron</persName> was not
                    always thinking of himself; like other authors, he sometimes wrote from imaginary
                    circumstances; and often fancied both situations and feelings which had no reference to his
                    own, nor to his experience. But were the matter deserving of the research, I am persuaded, that
                    with <persName key="ThMoore1852">Mr. Moore&#8217;s</persName> work, and the poet&#8217;s
                    original journals, notes, and letters, innumerable additions might be made to the list of
                    passages which the incidents of his own life dictated. </p>

                        <persName key="LdByron">Byron</persName> has not given some account of it himself; for the
                    manner in which he is represented to have acted towards his unfortunate partner, renders
                    another version of the tale desirable. At the same time&#8212;and I am not one of those who are
                    disposed to magnify the faults and infirmities of <persName>Byron</persName>&#8212;I fear there
                    is no excess of truth in <persName>Hunt&#8217;s</persName> opinion of him. I <pb
                        xml:id="JG.272"/> judge by an account which <persName>Lord Byron</persName> gave himself to
                    a mutual friend, who did not, however, see the treatment in exactly the same light as that in
                    which it appeared to me. But, while I cannot regard his Lordship&#8217;s conduct as otherwise
                    than unworthy, still the pains which <persName>Mr. Hunt</persName> has taken to elaborate his
                    character and dispositions into every modification of weakness, almost justifies us in thinking
                    that he was treated according to his deserts. <persName>Byron</persName> had at least the
                    manners of a gentleman, and though not a judicious knowledge of the world, he yet possessed
                    prudence enough not to be always unguarded. <persName>Mr. Hunt</persName> informs us, that when
                    he joined his Lordship at Leghorn, his own health was impaired, and that his disease rather
                    increased than diminished during his residence at Pisa and Genoa; to say nothing of the effect
                    which the loss of his friend had on him, and the disappointment he suffered in <name
                        type="title">The Liberal</name>; some excuse may, therefore, be made for him. In such a
                    condition, misapprehensions were natural; jocularity might be mistaken for sarcasm, and caprice
                    felt as insolence. </p>

                    <hi rend="small-caps">While</hi>&#160;<name type="title" key="Liberal1822">The Liberal</name>
                    was halting onward to its natural doom, the attention of <persName key="LdByron">Lord
                        Byron</persName> was attracted towards the struggles of Greece. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap42-2"> In that country his genius was first effectually developed; his name was
                    associated with many of its most romantic scenes, and the cause was popular with all the
                    educated and refined of Europe. He had formed besides a personal attachment to the land, and
                    perhaps many of his most agreeable local associations were fixed amid the ruins of Greece, and
                    in her desolated valleys. The name is indeed alone calculated to awaken the noblest feelings of
                    humanity. The spirit of her poets, the wisdom and the heroism of her worthies; whatever is
                    splendid in genius, unparalleled in art, glorious in arms, and wise in philosophy, is
                    associated in their highest excellence with that beautiful region. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap42-3"> Had <persName key="LdByron">Lord Byron</persName> never been in Greece, he
                    was, undoubtedly, one of those men whom the resurrection of her spirit was likeliest to
                    interest; but he was not also one fitted to do her cause much service. His innate indolence,
                    his sedentary habits, and that all-engrossing consideration for himself, which, in every
                    situation, marred his best impulses, were shackles upon the <pb xml:id="JG.274"/> practice of
                    the stern bravery in himself which he has so well expressed in his works. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap42-4"> It was expected when he sailed for Greece, nor was the expectation
                    unreasonable with those who believe imagination and passion to be of the same element, that the
                    enthusiasm which flamed so highly in his verse was the spirit of action, and would prompt him
                    to undertake some great enterprise. But he was only an artist; he could describe bold
                    adventures and represent high feeling, as other gifted individuals give eloquence to canvas and
                    activity to marble; but he did not possess the wisdom necessary for the instruction of
                    councils. I do, therefore, venture to say, that in embarking for Greece, he was not entirely
                    influenced by such exoterical motives as the love of glory or the aspirations of heroism. His
                    laurels had for some time ceased to flourish, the sear and yellow, the mildew and decay, had
                    fallen upon them, and he was aware that the bright round of his fame was ovalling from the full
                    and showing the dim rough edge of waning. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap42-5"> He was, moreover, tired of the <persName key="TeGuicc1873"
                        >Guiccioli</persName>, and again afflicted with a desire for some new object with which to
                    be in earnest. The Greek cause seemed to offer this, and a better chance for distinction than
                    any other pursuit in which he could then engage. In the spring of 1823 he accordingly made
                    preparations for transferring himself from Genoa to Greece, and opened a correspondence with
                    the leaders of the insurrection, that the importance of his adhesion might be duly appreciated. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap42-6"> Greece, with a fair prospect of ultimate success, was at that time as
                    distracted in her councils as ever. Her arms had been victorious, but the ancient jealousy of
                    the Greek mind was unmitigated. The third campaign had commenced, and yet no regular government
                    had been organized; the fiscal resources of the country were neglected; a wild energy against
                    the Ottomans was all that the Greeks could depend on for continuing the war. </p>

                <pb xml:id="JG.275"/>

                <p xml:id="chap42-7">
                    <persName key="LdByron">Lord Byron</persName> arrived in Cephalonia about the middle of August,
                    1823, where he fixed his residence for some time. This was prudent, but it said nothing for
                    that spirit of enterprise with which a man engaging in such a cause, in such a country, and
                    with such a people, ought to have been actuated&#8212;especially after <persName
                        key="MaBozza1823">Marco Botzaris</persName>, one of the best and most distinguished of the
                    chiefs, had earnestly urged him to join him at Missolonghi. I fear that I may not be able to do
                    justice to <persName>Byron&#8217;s</persName> part in the affairs of Greece; but I shall try.
                    He did not disappoint me, for he only acted as might have been expected, from his unsteady
                    energies. Many, however, of his other friends longed in vain to hear of that blaze of heroism,
                    by which they anticipated that his appearance in the field would be distinguished. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap42-8"> Among his earliest proceedings was the equipment of forty Suliotes, or
                    Albanians, whom he sent to <persName key="MaBozza1823">Marco Botzaris</persName> to assist in
                    the defence of Missolonghi. An adventurer of more daring would have gone with them; and when
                    the battle was over, in which <persName>Botzaris</persName> fell, he transmitted bandages and
                    medicines, of which he had brought a large supply from Italy, and pecuniary succour to the
                    wounded. This was considerate, but there was too much consideration in all that he did at this
                    time, neither in unison with the impulses of his natural character, nor consistent with the
                    heroic enthusiasm with which the admirers of his poetry imagined he was kindled. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap42-9"> In the mean time he had offered to advance one thousand dollars a month for
                    the succour of Missolonghi and the troops with <persName key="MaBozza1823">Marco
                        Botzaris</persName>; but the government, instead of accepting the offer, intimated that
                    they wished previously to confer with him, which he interpreted into a desire to direct the
                    expenditure of the money to other purposes. In his opinion his Lordship was probably not
                    mistaken; but his own account of his feeling in the business does not tend to exalt the
                    magnanimity of his attachment to the cause: <q>&#8220;I <pb xml:id="JG.276"/> will take
                        care,&#8221; says he, &#8220;that it is for the public cause, otherwise I will not advance
                        a para. The opposition say they want to cajole me, and the party in power say the others
                        wish to seduce me; so, between the two, I have a difficult part to play; however, I will
                        have nothing to do with the factions, unless to reconcile them, if possible.&#8221;</q>
                </p>

                <p xml:id="chap42-10"> It is difficult to conceive that <persName key="LdByron">Lord
                        Byron</persName>, <q>&#8220;the searcher of dark bosoms,&#8221;</q> could have expressed
                    himself so weakly and with such vanity; but the shadow of coming fate had already reached him,
                    and his judgment was suffering in the blight that had fallen on his reputation. To think of the
                    possibility of reconciling two Greek factions, or any factions, implies a degree of ignorance
                    of mankind, which, unless it had been given in his Lordship&#8217;s own writing, would not have
                    been credible; and as to having nothing to do with the factions, for what purpose went he to
                    Greece, unless it was to take a part with one of them? I abstain from saying what I think of
                    his hesitation in going to the government instead of sending two of his associated adventurers,
                        <persName key="EdTrela1881">Mr. Trelawney</persName> and <persName key="HaBrown1834">Mr.
                        Hamilton Brown</persName>, whom he despatched to collect intelligence as to the real state
                    of things, substituting their judgment for his own. When the Hercules, the ship he chartered to
                    carry him to Greece, weighed anchor, he was committed with the Greeks, and everything short of
                    unequivocal folly he was bound to have done with and for them. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap42-11"> His two emissaries or envoys proceeded to Tripolizza, where they found
                        <persName key="ThColoc1843">Colocotroni</persName> seated in the palace of the late vizier,
                        <persName key="VePasha1822">Velhi Pashaw</persName>, in great power; the court-yard and
                    galleries filled with armed men in garrison, while there was no enemy at that time in the Morea
                    able to come against them! The Greek chieftains, like their classic predecessors, though
                    embarked in the same adventure, were personal adversaries to each other.
                        <persName>Colocotroni</persName> spoke of his compeer <persName key="AlMavro1865"
                        >Mavro</persName>-<pb xml:id="JG.277"/>cordato in the very language of <persName
                        type="fiction">Agamemnon</persName>, when he said that he had declared to him, unless he
                    desisted from his intrigues, he would mount him on an ass and whip him out of the Morea; and
                    that he had only been restrained from doing so by the representation of his friends, who
                    thought it would injure their common cause. Such was the spirit of the chiefs of the factions
                    which <persName key="LdByron">Lord Byron</persName> thought it not impossible to reconcile! </p>

                <p xml:id="chap42-12"> At this time Missolonghi was in a critical state, being blockaded both by
                    land and sea; and the report of <persName key="EdTrela1881">Trelawney</persName> to
                        <persName>Lord Byron</persName> concerning it, was calculated to rouse his Lordship to
                    activity. <q>&#8220;There have been,&#8221; says he, &#8220;thirty battles fought and won by
                        the late <persName key="MaBozza1823">Marco Botzaris</persName>, and his gallant tribe of
                        Suliotes, who are shut up in Missolonghi. If it fall, Athens will be in danger, and
                        thousands of throats cut: a few thousand dollars would provide ships to relieve it; a
                        portion of this sum is raised, and I would coin my heart to save this key of
                        Greece.&#8221;</q> Bravely said! but deserving of little attention. The fate of Missolonghi
                    could have had no visible effect on that of Athens. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap42-13"> The distance between these two places is more than a hundred miles, and
                        <persName key="LdByron">Lord Byron</persName> was well acquainted with the local
                    difficulties of the intervening country; still it was a point to which the eyes of the Greeks
                    were all at that time directed; and <persName key="AlMavro1865">Mavrocordato</persName>, then
                    in correspondence with <persName>Lord Byron</persName>, and who was endeavouring to collect a
                    fleet for the relief of the place, induced his Lordship to undertake to provide the money
                    necessary for the equipment of the fleet, to the extent of twelve thousand pounds. It was on
                    this occasion his Lordship addressed a letter to the Greek chiefs, that deserves to be quoted,
                    for the sagacity with which it suggests what may be the conduct of the great powers of
                    Christendom. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap42-14">
                    <q> &#8220;I must frankly confess,&#8221; says he, &#8220;that unless <pb xml:id="JG.278"/>
                        union and order are confirmed, all hopes of a loan will be in vain, and all the assistance
                        which the Greeks could expect from abroad, an assistance which might be neither trifling
                        nor worthless, will be suspended or destroyed; and what is worse, the great powers of
                        Europe, of whom no one was an enemy to Greece, but seemed inclined to favour her in
                        consenting to the establishment of an independent power, will be persuaded that the Greeks
                        are unable to govern themselves, and will, perhaps, undertake to arrange your disorders in
                        such a way, as to blast the brightest hopes you indulge, and that are indulged by your
                        friends.&#8221; </q>
                </p>

                <p xml:id="chap42-15"> In the meantime, <persName key="LdByron">Lord Byron</persName> was still at
                    the villa he had hired in Cephalonia, where his conduct was rather that of a spectator than an
                    ally. <persName key="LdHarri5">Colonel Stanhope</persName>, in a letter of the 26th of
                    November, describes him as having been there about three months, and spending his time exactly
                    as every one acquainted with his habits must have expected. <q>&#8220;The first six weeks he
                        spent on board a merchant-vessel, and seldom went on shore, except on business. Since that
                        period he has lived in a little villa in the country, in absolute retirement, <persName
                            key="PiGamba1827">Count Gamba</persName> (brother to the <persName key="TeGuicc1873"
                            >Guiccioli</persName>) being his only companion.&#8221;</q>&#8212; Such, surely, was
                    not exactly playing that part in the Greek cause which he had taught the world to look for. It
                    is true, that the accounts received there of the Greek affairs were not then favourable.
                    Everybody concurred in representing the executive government as devoid of public virtue, and
                    actuated by avarice or personal ambition. This intelligence was certainly not calculated to
                    increase <persName>Lord Byron&#8217;s</persName> ardour, and may partly excuse the causes of
                    his personal inactivity. I say personal, because he had written to London to accelerate the
                    attempt to raise a loan, and, at the suggestion of <persName>Colonel Stanhope</persName>, he
                    addressed a letter to <persName key="AlMavro1865">Mavrocordato</persName> respecting the
                    inevitable consequences of their <pb xml:id="JG.279"/> calamitous dissensions. The object of
                    this letter was to induce a reconciliation between the rival factions, or to throw the odium,
                    of having thwarted the loan, upon the Executive, and thereby to degrade the members of it in
                    the opinion of the people. &#8220;I am very uneasy,&#8221; said his Lordship to the prince,
                        <q>&#8220;at hearing that the dissensions of Greece still continue; and at a moment when
                        she might triumph over everything in general, as she has triumphed in part. Greece is at
                        present placed between three measures; either to reconquer her liberty, or to become a
                        dependence of the sovereigns of Europe, or to return to a Turkish province; she has already
                        the choice only of these three alternatives. Civil war is but a road which leads to the two
                        latter. If she is desirous of the fate of Wallachia and the Crimea, she may obtain it <hi
                            rend="italic">to-morrow;</hi> if that of Italy, <hi rend="italic">the day after.</hi>

                    one after the other, without him. On the 29th of December, 1823, however, his Lordship did at

                    <hi rend="small-caps">While</hi>&#160;<persName key="LdByron">Lord Byron</persName> was
                    hesitating, in the Island of Cephalonia, about proceeding to Greece, an occurrence took place,
                    of which much has been made. I allude to the acquaintance he formed with a <persName
                        key="JaKenne1827">Dr. Kennedy</persName>, the publication of whose conversations with him
                    on religion has attracted some degree of public attention. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap43-2"> This gentleman was originally destined for the Scottish bar, but afterwards
                    became a student of medicine, and entering the medical department of the army, happened to be
                    stationed in Cephalonia when <persName key="LdByron">Lord Byron</persName> arrived. He appears
                    to have been a man of kind dispositions, possessed of a better heart than judgment; in all
                    places wherever his duty bore him he took a lively interest in the condition of the
                    inhabitants, and was active, both in his official and private capacity, to improve it. He had a
                    taste for circulating pious tracts, and zealously co-operated in distributing copies of the
                    Scriptures. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap43-3"> Firmly settled, himself, in a conviction of the truth of Christianity, he was
                    eager to make converts to his views of the doctrines; but whether he was exactly the kind of
                    apostle to achieve the conversion of <persName key="LdByron">Lord Byron</persName>
                    <pb xml:id="JG.281"/> may, perhaps, be doubted. His sincerity and the disinterestedness of his
                    endeavours would secure to him from his Lordship an indulgent and even patient hearing. But I
                    fear that without some more effectual calling, the arguments he appears to have employed were
                    not likely to have made <persName>Lord Byron</persName> a proselyte. His Lordship was so
                    constituted in his mind, and by his temperament, that nothing short of regeneration could have
                    made him a Christian, according to the gospel of <persName key="JaKenne1827">Dr.
                        Kennedy</persName>. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap43-4">
                    <persName key="LdByron">Lord Byron</persName> had but loose feelings in religion&#8212;scarcely
                    any. His sensibility and a slight constitutional leaning towards superstition and omens showed
                    that the sense of devotion was, however, alive and awake within him; but with him religion was
                    a sentiment, and the convictions of the understanding had nothing whatever to do with his
                    creed. That he was deeply imbued with the essence of natural piety; that he often felt the
                    power and being of a God thrilling in all his frame, and glowing in his bosom, I declare my
                    thorough persuasion; and that he believed in some of the tenets and in the philosophy of
                    Christianity, as they influence the spirit and conduct of men, I am as little disposed to
                    doubt; especially if those portions of his works which only trend towards the subject, and
                    which bear the impression of fervour and earnestness, may be admitted as evidence. But he was
                    not a member of any particular church, and, without a reconstruction of his mind and
                    temperament, I venture to say, he could not have become such; not in consequence, as too many
                    have represented, of any predilection, either of feeling or principle, against Christianity,
                    but entirely owing to an organic peculiarity of mind. He reasoned on every topic by instinct,
                    rather than by induction or any process of logic; and could never be so convinced of the truth
                    or falsehood of an abstract proposition, as to feel it affect the current of his actions. He
                    may have assented to ar-<pb xml:id="JG.282"/>guments, without being sensible of their truth;
                    merely because they were not objectionable to his feelings at the time. And, in the same
                    manner, he may have disputed even fair inferences, from admitted premises, if the state of his
                    feelings happened to be indisposed to the subject. I am persuaded, nevertheless, that to class
                    him among absolute infidels were to do injustice to his memory, and that he has suffered
                    uncharitably in the opinion of &#8220;the rigidly righteous,&#8221; who, because he had not
                    attached himself to any particular sect or congregation, assumed that he was an adversary to
                    religion. To claim for him any credit, as a pious man, would be absurd; but to suppose he had
                    not as deep an interest as other men &#8220;in his soul&#8217;s health&#8221; and welfare, was
                    to impute to him a nature which cannot exist. Being, altogether, a creature of impulses, he
                    certainly could not be ever employed in doxologies, or engaged in the logomachy of churchmen;
                    but he had the sentiment which at a tamer age might have made him more ecclesiastical. There
                    was as much truth as joke in the expression, when he wrote, <q>
                        <lg xml:id="JG.282a">
                            <l rend="indent60"> I am myself a moderate Presbyterian. </l>

                    </q>
                </p>

                <p xml:id="chap43-5"> A mind, constituted like that of <persName key="LdByron">Lord
                        Byron</persName>, was little susceptible of impressions from the arguments of ordinary men.
                    It was necessary that Truth, in visiting him, should come arrayed in her solemnities, and with
                    Awe and Reverence for her precursors. Acknowledged superiority, yea, celebrated wisdom, were
                    indispensable, to bespeak his sincere attention; and, without disparagement, it may be fairly
                    said, these were not the attributes of <persName key="JaKenne1827">Dr. Kennedy</persName>. On
                    the contrary, there was a taint of cant about him&#8212;perhaps he only acted like those who
                    have it&#8212;but still he was not exactly the dignitary to command unaffected deference from
                    the shrewd and irreverent author of <name type="title" key="LdByron.Juan">Don</name>
                    <pb xml:id="JG.283"/> Juan. The result verified what ought to have been the anticipation. The
                    doctor&#8217;s attempt to quicken <persName>Byron</persName> to a sense of grace failed; but
                    his Lordship treated him with politeness. The history of the affair will, however, be more
                    interesting than any reflections which it is in my humble power to offer. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap43-6"> Some of <persName key="JaKenne1827">Dr. Kennedy&#8217;s</persName>
                    acquaintances wished to hear him explain, in <q>&#8220;a logical and demonstrative manner, the
                        evidences and doctrines of Christianity;&#8221;</q> and <persName key="LdByron">Lord
                        Byron</persName>, hearing of the intended meeting, desired to be present, and was
                    accordingly invited. He attended; but was not present at several others which followed; he
                    however intimated to the Doctor, that he would be glad to converse with him, and the invitation
                    was accepted. <q>&#8220;On religion,&#8221; says the Doctor, &#8220;his Lordship was in general
                        a hearer, proposing his difficulties and objections with more fairness than could have been
                        expected from one under similar circumstances; and with so much candour, that they often
                        seemed to be proposed more for the purpose of procuring information, or satisfactory
                        answers, than from any other motive.&#8221;</q>
                </p>

                <p xml:id="chap43-7"> At the first meeting, <persName key="JaKenne1827">Dr. Kennedy</persName>
                    explained, becomingly, his views of the subject, and that he had read every work against
                    Christianity which fell in his way. It was this consideration which had induced him with such
                    confidence to enter upon the discussion, knowing, on the one hand, the strength of
                    Christianity, and, on the other, the weakness of its assailants. <q>&#8220;To show you,
                        therefore,&#8221; said the Doctor, &#8220;the grounds on which I demand your attention to
                        what I may say on the nature and evidence of Christianity, I shall mention the names of
                        some of the authors whose works I have read or consulted.&#8221;</q> When he had mentioned
                    all these names, <persName key="LdByron">Lord Byron</persName> asked if he had read <persName
                        key="IsBarro1677">Barrow&#8217;s</persName> and <persName key="EdStill1699"
                        >Stillingfleet&#8217;s</persName> works? The Doctor replied, <q>&#8220;I have seen them,
                        but I have not read them.&#8221;</q>
                </p>

                <pb xml:id="JG.284"/>

                <p xml:id="chap43-8"> After a disquisition, chiefly relative to the history of Christianity,
                        <persName key="JaKenne1827">Dr. Kennedy</persName> observed, <q>&#8220;We must, on all
                        occasions, but more particularly in fair and logical discussions with sceptics, or Deists,
                        make a distinction between Christianity, as it is found in the Scriptures, and the errors,
                        abuses, and imperfections of Christians themselves.&#8221;</q> To this his Lordship
                    remarked, that he always had taken care to make that distinction, as he knew enough of
                    Christianity to feel that it was both necessary and just. The Doctor remarked that the contrary
                    was almost universally the case with those who doubted or denied the truth of Christianity, and
                    proceeded to illustrate the statement. He then read a summary of the fundamental doctrines of
                    Christianity; but he had not proceeded far, when he observed signs of impatience in <persName
                        key="LdByron">Lord Byron</persName>, who inquired if these sentiments accorded with the
                    doctor&#8217;s? and being answered they did, and with those of all sound Christians, except in
                    one or two minor things, his Lordship rejoined, that he did not wish to hear the opinions of
                    others, whose writings he could read at any time, but only his own. The Doctor then read on
                    till coming to the expression &#8220;grace of God,&#8221; his Lordship inquired, <q>&#8220;what
                        do you mean by grace?&#8221;</q>
                    <q>&#8220;The primary and fundamental meaning of the word,&#8221; replied the Doctor, somewhat
                        surprised at his ignorance (I quote his own language), &#8220;is favour; though it varies
                        according to the context to express that disposition of God which leads Him to grant a
                        favour, the action of doing so, or the favour itself, or its effects on those who receive
                        it.&#8221;</q> The arrogance of the use of the term ignorance here, requires no
                    animadversion; but to suppose the greatest master, then in existence, of the English language,
                    not acquainted with the meaning of the word, when he asked to be informed of the meaning
                    attached to it by the individual making use of it, gives us some insight into the true
                    character of the teacher. The Doctor closed the book, as he <pb xml:id="JG.285"/> perceived
                    that <persName>Lord Byron</persName>, as he says, had no distinct conception of many of the
                    words used; and his Lordship subjoined, <q>&#8220;What we want is, to be convinced that the
                        Bible is true; because if we can believe that, it will follow as a matter of course, that
                        we must believe all the doctrines it contains.&#8221;</q>
                </p>

                <p xml:id="chap43-9"> The reply to this was to the effect, that the observation was partly just;
                    but though the strongest evidence were produced of the Scriptures being the revealed will of
                    God, they (his Lordship and others present) would still remain unbelievers, unless they knew
                    and comprehended the doctrines contained in the Scriptures. This was not conclusive, and
                        <persName key="LdByron">Lord Byron</persName> replied, that they wished him to prove that
                    the Scriptures were the word of God, which the Doctor, with more than apostolic simplicity,
                    said that such was his object, but he should like to know what they deemed the clearest course
                    to follow with that object in view. After some farther conversation&#8212;<q>&#8220;No other
                        plan was proposed by them,&#8221; says the Doctor; and, he adds, &#8220;They had violated
                        their engagement to hear me for twelve hours, for which I had stipulated.&#8221;</q> This
                    may, perhaps, satisfy the reader as to the quality of the Doctor&#8217;s understanding; but as
                    the subject, in its bearing, touches <persName>Lord Byron&#8217;s</persName> character, I shall
                    proceed a little farther into the marrow of the matter. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap43-10"> The inculcation being finished for that evening, <persName key="LdByron"
                        >Lord Byron</persName> said, that when he was young his mother brought him up strictly; and
                    that he had access to a great many theological works, and remembered that he was particularly
                    pleased with <persName key="IsBarro1677">Barrow&#8217;s</persName> writings, and that he also
                    went regularly to church. He declared that he was not an infidel, who denied the Scriptures and
                    wished to remain in unbelief; on the contrary, he was desirous to believe, as he experienced no
                    happiness in having his religious opinions so unsteady and unfixed. But he could not, he added,
                    understand the Scriptures. <q>&#8220;Those people who con-<pb xml:id="JG.286"/>scientiously
                        believe, I always have respected, and was always disposed to trust in them more than in
                        others.&#8221;</q> A desultory conversation then ensued, respecting the language and
                    translations of the Scriptures; in the course of which his Lordship remarked, that
                        <persName>Scott</persName>, in his Commentary on the Bible, did not say that it was the
                    devil who tempted <persName>Eve</persName>, nor does the Bible say a word about the devil. It
                    is only said that the serpent spoke, and that it was the subtlest of all the beasts of the
                    field.&#8212;Will it be said that truth and reason were served by <persName key="JaKenne1827"
                        >Dr. Kennedy&#8217;s</persName>* answer? <persName>&#8220;As beasts have not the faculty of
                        speech, the just inference is, that the beast was only an instrument made use of by some
                        invisible and superior being. The Scriptures accordingly tell us, that the devil is the
                        father of lies&#8212;the lie made by the serpent to <persName>Eve</persName> being the
                        first we have on record; they call him also a murderer from the beginning, as he was the
                        cause of the sentence of death which was pronounced against <persName>Adam</persName> and
                        all his posterity; and still farther, to remove all doubt, and to identify him as the agent
                        who used the serpent as an instrument, he is called the serpent&#8212;the
                        devil.&#8221;</persName>
                </p>

                <p xml:id="chap43-11">
                    <persName key="LdByron">Lord Byron</persName> inquired what the doctor thought of the theory of
                        <persName key="WiWarbu1779">Warburton</persName>, that the Jews had no distinct idea of a
                    future state? The Doctor acknowledged that he had often seen, but had never read <name

                <p xml:id="chap43-12"> His Lordship then said, that one of the greatest difficulties he had met

                    proclaimed; and after some of the customary commonplaces, he ascribed much of the existing evil

                <p xml:id="chap43-13">
                    <q>&#8220;Is there not,&#8221; said his Lordship, &#8220;some part of the New Testament where
                        it appears that the disciples were struck with the state of physical evil, and made
                        inquiries into the cause?&#8221;</q>&#8212;<q>&#8220;There are two passages,&#8221; was the
                        reply. The disciples inquired, when they saw a man who had been born blind, whether it was
                        owing to his own or his parents&#8217; sin?&#8212;and, after quoting the other instance, he
                        concludes, that moral and physical evil in individuals are not always a judgment or
                        punishment, but are intended to answer certain ends in the government of the world.</q>
                </p>

                <p xml:id="chap43-14">
                    <q>&#8220;Is there not,&#8221; said his Lordship, &#8220;a prophecy in the New Testament which
                        it is alleged has not been fulfilled, although it was declared that the end of the world
                        would come before the generation then existing should pass
                        away?&#8221;</q>&#8212;<q>&#8220;The prediction,&#8221; said Dr. Kennedy, &#8220;related to
                        the destruction of Jerusalem, which certainly took place within the time assigned; though
                        some of the expressions descriptive of the signs of that remarkable event are of such a
                        nature as to appear to apply to Christ&#8217;s coming to judge the world at the end of
                        time.&#8221;</q>
                </p>

                <p xml:id="chap43-15"> His Lordship then asked, if the doctor thought that there had been fewer
                    wars and persecutions, and less slaughter and misery, in the world since the introduction of
                    Christianity than before? The Doctor answered this by observing, that since Christianity
                    inculcates peace and good-will to all men, we must always separate pure religion from the
                    abuses of which its professors are guilty. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap43-16"> Two other opinions were expressed by his Lordship in the conversation. The
                    Doctor, in speaking of the sovereignty of God, had alluded to the similitude of <pb
                        xml:id="JG.288"/> the potter and his clay; for his Lordship said, if he were broken in
                    pieces, he would say to the potter, <q>&#8220;Why do you treat me thus?&#8221;</q> The other
                    was an absurdity. It was&#8212;if the whole world were going to hell, he would prefer going
                    with them than go alone to heaven. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap43-17"> Such was the result of the first council of Cephalonia, if one may venture
                    the allusion. It is manifest, without saying much for <persName key="LdByron">Lord
                        Byron&#8217;s</persName> ingenuity, that he was fully a match for the Doctor, and that he
                    was not unacquainted with the subject under discussion. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap43-18"> In the next conversation <persName key="LdByron">Lord Byron</persName>
                    repeated, <q>&#8220;I have no wish to reject Christianity without investigation; on the
                        contrary, I am very desirous of believing. But I do not see very much the need of a
                        Saviour, nor the utility of prayer. Devotion is the affection of the heart, and this I
                        feel. When I view the wonders of creation, I bow to the Majesty of Heaven; and when I feel
                        the enjoyments of life, I feel grateful to God for having bestowed them upon me.&#8221;</q>
                    Upon this some discussion arose, turning chiefly on the passage in the third chapter of John,
                        <q>&#8220;Unless a man is converted, he cannot enter the kingdom of Heaven;&#8221;</q>
                    which naturally led to an explanatory interlocutor, concerning new birth, regeneration,
                    &amp;c.; and thence diverged into the topics which had been the subject of the former
                    conversation. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap43-19"> Among other things, <persName key="LdByron">Lord Byron</persName> inquired,
                        <q>&#8220;if the Doctor really thought that the devil appeared before God, as is mentioned
                        in the Book of Job, or is it only an allegorical or poetical mode of
                    speaking?&#8221;</q>&#8212;The reply was, <q>&#8220;I believe it in the strict and literal
                        meaning.&#8221;</q>
                </p>

                <p xml:id="chap43-20">
                    <q> &#8220;If it be received in a literal sense,&#8221; said his Lordship, &#8220;it gives me a
                        much higher idea of the majesty, power, and wisdom of God, to believe that the devils
                        themselves are at his nod, and are subject to his control, with as much ease as the
                        elements of nature fol-<pb xml:id="JG.289"/>low the respective laws which his will has
                        assigned them.&#8221; </q>
                </p>

                <p xml:id="chap43-21">
                    <q> This notion was characteristic, and the poetical feeling in which it originated, when the
                        Doctor attempted to explain the doctrine of the Manicheans, was still more distinctly
                        developed; for his Lordship again expressed how much the belief of the real appearance of
                            <persName>Satan</persName>, to hear and obey the commands of God, added to his views of
                        the grandeur and majesty of the Creator. </q>
                </p>

                <p xml:id="chap43-22"> This second conversation was more desultory than the first; religion was
                    brought in only incidentally, until his Lordship said, <q>&#8220;I do not reject the doctrines
                        of Christianity; I want only sufficient proofs of it, to take up the profession in earnest;
                        and I do not believe myself to be so bad a Christian as many of them who preach against me
                        with the greatest fury&#8212;many of whom I have never seen nor injured.&#8221;</q>
                </p>

                <p xml:id="chap43-23">
                    <q> &#8220;You have only to examine the causes which prevent you&#8221; (from being a true
                        believer), said the Doctor, &#8220;and you will find they are futile, and only tend to
                        withhold you from the enjoyment of real happiness; which at present it is impossible you
                        can find.&#8221; </q>
                </p>

                <p xml:id="chap43-24">
                    <q> &#8220;What, then, you think me in a very bad way?&#8221; </q>
                </p>

                <p xml:id="chap43-25">
                    <q> &#8220;I certainly think you are,&#8221; was the reply; &#8220;and this I say, not on my
                        own authority, but on that of the Scriptures.&#8212;Your Lordship must be converted, and
                        must be reformed, before anything can be said of you, except that you are bad, and in a bad
                        way.&#8221; </q>
                </p>

                <p xml:id="chap43-26">
                    <q> &#8220;But,&#8221; replied his Lordship, &#8220;I already believe in predestination, which
                        I know you believe, and in the depravity of the human heart in general, and of my own in
                        particular; thus you see there are two points in which we agree. I shall get at the others
                        by-and-by. You cannot expect me to become a perfect Christian at once.&#8221; </q>
                </p>

                <p xml:id="chap43-27"> And farther his Lordship subjoined: </p>

                <p xml:id="chap43-28">
                    <q> &#8220;Predestination appears to me just; from my <pb xml:id="JG.290"/> own reflection and
                        experience, I am influenced in a way which is incomprehensible, and am led to do things
                        which I never intended; and if there is, as we all admit, a Supreme Ruler of the universe;
                        and if, as you say, he has the actions of the devils, as well as of his own angels,
                        completely at his command, then those influences, or those arrangements of circumstances,
                        which lead us to do things against our will, or with ill-will, must be also under his
                        directions. But I have never entered into the depths of the subject; I have contented
                        myself with believing that there is a predestination of events, and that predestination
                        depends on the will of God.&#8221; </q>
                </p>

                    <persName key="JaKenne1827">Dr. Kennedy</persName>, in speaking of this second conversation,
                    bears testimony to the respectfulness of his Lordship&#8217;s attention. <q>&#8220;There was
                        nothing in his manner which approached to levity, or anything that indicated a wish to mock
                        at religion; though, on the other hand, an able dissembler would have done and said all
                        that he did, with such feelings and intentions.&#8221;</q>
                </p>

                <p xml:id="chap43-30"> Subsequent to the second conversation, <persName key="JaKenne1827">Dr.
                        Kennedy</persName> asked a gentleman who was intimate with <persName key="LdByron">Lord
                        Byron</persName>, if he really thought his Lordship serious in his desire to hear religion
                    explained. <q>&#8220;Has he exhibited any contempt or ridicule at what I have said?&#8221;</q>
                    This gentleman assured him that he had never heard <persName>Byron</persName> allude to the
                    subject in any way which could induce him to suspect that he was merely amusing himself.
                        <q>&#8220;But, on the contrary, he always names you with respect. I do not, however, think
                        you have made much impression on him: he is just the same fellow as before. He says, he
                        does not know what religion you are of, for you neither adhere to creeds nor
                        councils.&#8221;</q>
                </p>

                <p xml:id="chap43-31"> It ought here to be noticed, as showing the general opinion entertained of
                    his Lordship with respect to these polemical conversations, that the wits of the garrison made
                    themselves merry with what was going <pb xml:id="JG.291"/> on. Some of them affected to
                    believe, or did so, that <persName key="LdByron">Lord Byron&#8217;s</persName> wish to hear
                        <persName key="JaKenne1827">Dr. Kennedy</persName> proceeded from a desire to have an
                    accurate idea of the opinions and manners of the Methodists, in order that he might make
                        <persName type="fiction">Don Juan</persName> become one for a time, and so be enabled to
                    paint their conduct with greater accuracy. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap43-32"> The third conversation took place soon after this comment had been made on
                        <persName key="LdByron">Lord Byron&#8217;s</persName> conduct. The Doctor inquired if his
                    Lordship had read any of the religious books he had sent. <q>&#8220;I have looked,&#8221;
                        replied <persName>Byron</persName>, &#8220;into <persName key="ThBosto1732"

                        me.&#8221;</q>
                </p>

                <p xml:id="chap43-33"> Although there was no systematic design, on the part of <persName
                        key="LdByron">Lord Byron</persName>, to make <persName key="JaKenne1827">Dr.
                        Kennedy</persName> subservient to any scheme of ridicule; yet it is evident that he was not
                    so serious as the doctor so meritoriously desired. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap43-34">
                    <q> &#8220;I have begun,&#8221; said his Lordship, &#8220;very fairly; I have given some of
                        your tracts to <persName key="WiFletc1831">Fletcher</persName> (his valet), who is a good
                        sort of man, but still wants, like myself, some reformation; and I hope he will spread them
                        among the other servants, who require it still more. <persName key="FrBruno1828"
                            >Bruno</persName>, the physician, and <persName key="PiGamba1827">Gamba</persName>, are
                        busy, reading some of the Italian tracts; and I hope it will have a good effect on them.
                        The former is rather too decided against it at present; and too much engaged with a spirit
                        of enthusiasm for his own profession, to attend to other subjects; but we must have
                        patience, and we shall see what has been the result. I do not fail to read, from time to
                        time, my Bible, though not, perhaps, so much as I should.&#8221; </q>
                </p>

                <p xml:id="chap43-35">
                    <q> &#8220;Have you begun to pray that you may understand it?&#8221; </q>
                </p>

                <p xml:id="chap43-36">
                    <q> &#8220;Not yet. I have not arrived at that pitch of faith yet; but it may come by-and-by.
                        You are in too great a hurry.&#8221; </q>
                </p>

                <p xml:id="chap43-37"> His Lordship then went to a side-table, on which a <pb xml:id="JG.292"/>
                    great number of books were ranged; and, taking hold of an octavo, gave it to the Doctor. It was
                        <name type="title">Illustrations of the Moral Government of God</name>, by <persName>E.
                        Smith, M.D.</persName>, London. &#8220;The author,&#8221; said he, &#8220;proves that the
                    punishment of hell is not eternal; it will have a termination.&#8221; </p>

                <p xml:id="chap43-38">
                    <q> &#8220;The author,&#8221; replied the Doctor, &#8220;is, I suppose, one of the Socinians;
                        who, in a short time, will try to get rid of every doctrine in the Bible. How did your
                        Lordship get hold of this book?&#8221; </q>
                </p>

                <p xml:id="chap43-39">
                    <q> &#8220;They sent it out to me from England, to make a convert of me, I suppose. The
                        arguments are strong, drawn from the Bible itself; and by showing that a time will come
                        when every intelligent creature shall be supremely happy, and eternally so, it expunges
                        that shocking doctrine, that sin and misery will for ever exist under the government of
                        God, Whose highest attribute is love and goodness. To my present apprehension, it would be
                        a most desirable thing, could it be proved that, alternately, all created beings were to be
                        happy. This would appear to be most consistent with the nature of God.&#8212;I cannot yield
                        to your doctrine of the eternal duration of punishment.&#8212;This author&#8217;s opinion
                        is more humane; and, I think, he supports it very strongly from Scripture.&#8221; </q>
                </p>

                <p xml:id="chap43-40"> The fourth conversation was still more desultory, being carried on at table
                    amid company; in the course of it <persName key="LdByron">Lord Byron</persName>, however,
                    declared <q>&#8220;that he was so much of a believer as to be of opinion that there is no
                        contradiction in the Scriptures which cannot be reconciled by an attentive consideration
                        and comparison of passages.&#8221;</q>
                </p>

                <p xml:id="chap43-41"> It is needless to remark that <persName key="LdByron">Lord Byron</persName>,
                    in the course of these conversations, was incapable of preserving a consistent seriousness. The
                    volatility of his humour was constantly leading him into playfulness, and he never lost an
                    opportunity of making a pun or saying a quaint thing. &#8220;Do you know,&#8221; said he to <pb
                        xml:id="JG.293"/> the Doctor, <q>&#8220;I am nearly reconciled to <persName key="Paul">St.
                            Paul</persName>; for he says there is no difference between the Jews and the Greeks,
                        and I am exactly of the same opinion, for the character of both is equally vile.&#8221;</q>
                </p>

                <p xml:id="chap43-42"> Upon the whole it must be conceded, that whatever was the degree of
                        <persName key="LdByron">Lord Byron&#8217;s</persName> dubiety as to points of faith and
                    doctrine, he could not be accused of gross ignorance, nor described as animated by any hostile
                    feeling against religion. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap43-43"> In this sketch of these conversations, I have restricted myself chiefly to
                    those points which related to his Lordship&#8217;s own sentiments and belief. It would have
                    been inconsistent with the concise limits of this work to have detailed the controversies. A
                    fair summary of what <persName key="LdByron">Byron</persName> did not believe, what he was
                    disposed to believe but had not satisfied himself with the evidence, and what he did believe,
                    seemed to be the task I ought to undertake. The result confirmed the statement of his
                    Lordship&#8217;s religious condition, given in the preliminary remarks which, I ought to
                    mention, were written before I looked into <persName key="JaKenne1827">Dr.
                        Kennedy&#8217;s</persName> book; and the statement is not different from the estimate which
                    the conversations warrant. It is true that <persName>Lord Byron&#8217;s</persName> part in the
                    conversations is not very characteristic; but the integrity of <persName>Dr. Kennedy</persName>
                    is a sufficient assurance that they are substantially correct. </p>

                    on board a quantity of specie. Although the distance from Zante to Missolonghi is but a few
                    hours&#8217; sail, the voyage was yet not without adventures. Missolonghi, as I have already
                    mentioned, was then blockaded by the Turks, and some address was necessary, on that account, to
                    effect an entrance, independent of the difficulties, at all times, of navigating the canals

                                two carbines and some pistols, and, I suspect, not more than four fighting people

                        <persName key="AlMavro1865">Prince Mavrocordato</persName>, and all the authorities, with
                    the troops and the population, met him on his landing, and accompanied him to the house which
                    had been prepared for him, amid the shouts of the multitude and the discharge of cannon. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap44-3"> In the mean time, <persName key="PiGamba1827">Count Gamba</persName> and his

                    expected to share the fate of certain unfortunate prisoners whom that stern chief had
                    sacrificed the preceding year at Prevesa; and their fears would probably have been realised but
                    for the intrepid presence of mind displayed by the Count, who, assuming a haughty style,
                    accused the Ottoman captain of the frigate of a breach of neutrality, in detaining a vessel
                    under English colours, and concluded by telling the Pashaw that he might expect the vengeance
                    of the British Government in thus interrupting a nobleman who was merely on his travels, and
                    bound to Calamata. Perhaps, however, another circumstance had quite as much influence with the
                    Pashaw as this bravery. In the master of the vessel he recognised a person who had saved his
                    life in the Black Sea fifteen years before, and in consequence not only consented to the
                    vessel&#8217;s release, but treated the whole of the passengers with the utmost attention, and
                    even urged them to take a day&#8217;s shooting in the neighbourhood.* </p>

                        not rare among them: I experienced a remarkable example of it myself. Having entered Widin
                        when it was besieged by the Russians, in the winter of 1810&#8212;11, I was closely

                        should deliver my letters and papers to be examined. This I refused to do, unless he had a
                        person who could read English, and understand it when spoken. In the mean time my Tartar,
                        the better to prove our innocence of all sinister purposes, turned out the contents of his

                <p xml:id="chap44-4"> The first measure which his Lordship attempted after his arrival, was to
                    mitigate the ferocity with which the war was carried on; one of the objects, as he explained to
                    my friend who visited him at Genoa, which induced him to embark in the cause. And it happened
                    that the very day he reached the town was signalised by his rescuing a Turk who had fallen into
                    the hands of some Greek sailors. This man was clothed by his Lordship&#8217;s orders, and sent
                    over to Patras; and soon after <persName key="PiGamba1827">Count Gamba&#8217;s</persName>
                    release, hearing that four other Turks were prisoners in Missolonghi, he requested that they
                    might be placed in his hands, which was immediately granted. These he also sent to Patras, with
                    a letter, of which a copy is <note place="foot">
                        <p xml:id="JG.297-n1">
                            <persName>Prince Italinski</persName>, from the French minister at Constantinople. This
                            I of course instantly ordered to be delivered to the pashaw. In the evening, an old
                            Turk who had been present during the proceedings, and at the subsequent consultations
                            as to what should be done with me, called, and advised me to leave the town; telling me
                            at the same time, that when he was a boy he had been taken prisoner by the Hungarians
                            at Belgrade, and had been so kindly treated, that after being sent home he had never
                            ceased to long for an opportunity of repaying that kindness to some other Frank, and
                            that he thought my case afforded an opportunity. He concluded by offering me the use of
                            twenty thousand piastres, about a thousand pounds sterling, to take me across the
                            continent to England. I was then on my way to Orsova, to meet a gentleman from Vienna,
                            but being informed that he would not be there, I resolved to return to Constantinople,
                            and accordingly accepted from the Turk so much money as would serve for the expenses of
                            the journey, giving him an order for repayment on an agent whose name he had never
                            heard of, nor any one probably in the town. The whole adventure was curious, and ought
                            to be mentioned, as affording a favourable view of Ottoman magnanimity. </p>
                        <p xml:id="JG.297-n2"> The pashaw was so well pleased with the manner in which I had acted
                            in the affair of the despatches, that he sent me notice in the morning that horses and
                            a guard were at my command so long as I chose to remain in the fortress, and that he
                            had forwarded the packet unbroken to the Russian commander; he even permitted me, in
                            the course of the afternoon, to visit the Russian encampment on the other side of the
                            Danube, which I accordingly did, and returned across the river in the evening. </p>

                    sides would be treated with humanity. This act was followed by another equally praiseworthy. A
                    Greek cruiser having captured a Turkish boat, in which there was a number of passengers,
                    chiefly women and children, they were also placed at the disposal of his Lordship, at his
                    particular request. <persName key="WiParry1859">Captain Parry</persName> has given a
                    description of the scene between <persName key="LdByron">Lord Byron</persName>, and that
                    multitude of mothers and children, too interesting to be omitted here. <q>&#8220;I was summoned
                        to attend him, and receive his orders that everything should be done which might contribute
                        to their comfort. He was seated on a cushion at the upper end of the room, the women and
                        children were standing before him with their eyes fixed steadily on him; and on his right
                        hand was his interpreter, who was extracting from the women a narrative of their
                        sufferings. One of them, apparently about thirty years of age, possessing great vivacity,
                        and whose manners and dress, though she was then dirty and disfigured, indicated that she
                        was superior in rank and condition to her companions, was spokeswoman for the whole. I
                        admired the good order the others preserved, never interfering with the explanation, or
                        interrupting the single speaker. I also admired the rapid manner in which the interpreter
                        explained everything they said, so as to make it almost appear that there was but one
                        speaker. After a short time it was evident that what <persName>Lord Byron</persName> was
                        hearing affected his feelings; his countenance changed, his colour went and came, and I
                        thought he was ready to weep. But he had, on all occasions, a ready and peculiar knack in
                        turning conversation from any disagreeable or unpleasant subject; and he had recourse to
                        this expedient. He rose up suddenly, and, turning round on his heel as was his wont, he
                        said something to his interpreter, who immediately repeated it to the women. <pb
                            xml:id="JG.299"/> All eyes were immediately fixed on me; and one of the party, a young
                        and beautiful woman, spoke very warmly. <persName>Lord Byron</persName> seemed satisfied,
                        and said they might retire. The women all slipped off their shoes in an instant, and, going
                        up to his Lordship, each in succession, accompanied by their children, kissed his hand
                        fervently, invoked, in the Turkish manner, a blessing, both on his hand and heart, and then
                        quitted the room. This was too much for <persName>Lord Byron</persName>, and he turned his
                        face away to conceal his emotion&#8221;</q>
                </p>

                <p xml:id="chap44-5"> A vessel was then hired, and the whole of them, to the number of twenty-four,
                    were sent to Prevesa, provided with every requisite for their comfort during the passage. These
                    instances of humanity excited a sympathy among the Turks. The Governor of Prevesa thanked his
                    Lordship, and assured him that he would take care that equal attention should be in future paid
                    to the Greeks, who might fall into his hands. </p>

                    Missolonghi was not only hailed as a new era in the history of Greece, but as the beginning of
                    a new cycle in his own extraordinary life. His natural indolence disappeared; the Sardanapalian
                    sloth was thrown off, and he took a station in the van of her efforts that bespoke heroic
                    achievement. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap45-2"> After paying the fleet, which indeed had only come out in the expectation of
                    receiving the arrears from the loan he had promised to <persName key="AlMavro1865"
                        >Mavrocordato</persName>, he resolved to form a brigade of Suliotes. Five hundred of the
                    remains of <persName key="MaBozza1823">Marco Botzaris&#8217;s</persName> gallant followers were
                    accordingly taken into his pay. <q>&#8220;He burns with military ardour and chivalry,&#8221;
                        says <persName key="LdHarri5">Colonel Stanhope</persName>, &#8220;and will proceed with the
                        expedition to Lepanto.&#8221;</q> But the expedition was delayed by causes which ought to
                    have been foreseen. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap45-3"> The Suliotes, conceiving that in his Lordship they had found a patron whose
                    wealth and generosity were equally boundless, refused to quit Missolonghi till their arrears
                    were paid. Savage in the field, and untamable in the city, they became insubordinate and
                    mercenary; nor was their conduct without excuse. They had long defended the town with untired
                    bravery; <pb xml:id="JG.301"/> their families had been driven into it in the most destitute
                    condition; and all the hopes that had led them to take up arms were still distant and
                    prospective. Besides, <persName key="AlMavro1865">Mavrocordato</persName>, unlike the other
                    Grecian captains, having no troops of his own, affected to regard these mercenaries as allies,
                    and was indulgent to their excesses. The town was overawed by their turbulence, conflicts took
                    place in the street; riot and controversy everywhere prevailed, and blood was shed. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap45-4">
                    <persName key="LdByron">Lord Byron&#8217;s</persName> undisciplined spirit could ill brook
                    delay; he partook of the general vehemence, and lost the power of discerning the comparative
                    importance both of measures and things. He was out of his element; confusion thickened around
                    him; his irritability grew into passion; and there was the rush and haste, the oblivion and
                    alarm of fatality in all he undertook and suggested. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap45-5"> One day, a party of German adventurers reached the fortress so demoralized by
                    hardships, that few of them were fit for service. It was intended to form a corps of artillery,
                    and these men were destined for that branch of the service; but their condition was such, that
                        <persName key="LdHarri5">Stanhope</persName> doubted the practicability of carrying the
                    measure into effect at that time. He had promised to contribute a hundred pounds to their
                    equipment. <persName key="LdByron">Byron</persName> attributed the Colonel&#8217;s objections
                    to reluctance to pay the money; and threatened him if it were refused, with a punishment, new
                    in Grecian war&#8212;&#8212;to libel him in the <name type="title">Greek Chronicle</name>! a
                    newspaper which <persName>Stanhope</persName> had recently established. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap45-6"> It is, however, not easy to give a correct view of the state of affairs at
                    that epoch in Missolonghi. All parties seem to have been deplorably incompetent to understand
                    the circumstances in which they were placed;&#8212;the condition of the Greeks, and that their
                    exigencies required only physical and military means. <pb xml:id="JG.302"/> They talked of
                    newspapers, and types,* and libels, as if the moral instruments of civil exhortation were
                    adequate to wrench the independence of Greece from the bloody grasp of the Ottoman. No wonder
                    that <persName key="LdByron">Byron</persName>, accustomed to the management only of his own
                    fancies, was fluttered amid the conflicts of such riot and controversy. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap45-7"> His situation at this period was indeed calculated to inspire pity. Had he
                    survived, it might, instead of awakening the derision of history, have supplied to himself

                <p xml:id="chap46-1">
                    <hi rend="small-caps">Three</hi> days after the conversation related in the preceding chapter,
                        <persName key="LdByron">Byron</persName> was officially placed in the command of about
                    three thousand men, destined for the attack on Lepanto; but the Suliotes remained refractory,
                    and refused to quit their quarters; his Lordship, however, employed an argument which proved
                    effectual. He told them that if they did not obey his commands, he would discharge them from
                    his service. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap46-2"> But the impediments were not to be surmounted; in less than a week it was
                    formally reported to <persName key="LdByron">Byron</persName> that Missolonghi could not
                    furnish the means of undertaking the siege of Lepanto, upon which his Lordship proposed that
                    Lepanto should be only blockaded by two thousand men. Before any actual step was, however,
                    taken, two spies came in with a report that the Albanians in garrison at Lepanto had seized the
                    citadel, and were determined to surrender it to his Lordship. Still the expedition lingered; at
                    last, on the 14th of February, six weeks after <persName>Byron&#8217;s</persName> arrival at
                    Missolonghi, it was determined that an advanced guard of three hundred soldiers, under the
                    command of <persName key="PiGamba1827">Count Gamba</persName>, should march for Lepanto, and
                    that <pb xml:id="JG.307"/>
                    <persName>Lord Byron</persName>, with the main body, should follow. The Suliotes were, however,
                    still exorbitant, calling for fresh contributions for themselves and their families. His
                    troubles were increasing, and every new rush of the angry tide rose nearer and nearer his
                    heart; still his fortitude enabled him to preserve an outward show of equanimity. But, on the
                    very day after the determination had been adopted, to send forward the advanced guard, his
                    constitution gave way. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap46-3"> He was sitting in <persName key="LdHarri5">Colonel
                        Stanhope&#8217;s</persName> room, talking jestingly, according to his wonted manner, with
                        <persName key="WiParry1859">Captain Parry</persName>, when his eyes and forehead
                    occasionally discovered that he was agitated by strong feelings. On a sudden he complained of a
                    weakness in one of his legs; he rose, but finding himself unable to walk, called for
                    assistance; he then fell into a violent nervous convulsion, and was placed upon a bed: while
                    the fit lasted, his face was hideously distorted; but in the course of a few minutes the
                    convulsion ceased, and he began to recover his senses: his speech returned, and he soon rose,
                    apparently well. During the struggle his strength was preternaturally augmented, and when it
                    was over, he behaved with his usual firmness. <q>&#8220;I conceive,&#8221; says
                            <persName>Colonel Stanhope</persName>, &#8220;that this fit was occasioned by
                        over-excitement. The mind of <persName key="LdByron">Byron</persName> is like a volcano; it
                        is full of fire, wrath, and combustibles, and when this matter comes to be strongly
                        agitated, the explosion is dreadful. With respect to the causes which produced the excess
                        of feeling, they are beyond my reach, except one great cause, the provoking conduct of the
                        Suliotes.&#8221;</q>
                </p>

                <p xml:id="chap46-4"> A few days after this distressing incident, a new occurrence arose, which
                    materially disturbed the tranquillity of <persName key="LdByron">Byron</persName>. A Suliote,
                    accompanied by the son, a little boy, of <persName key="MaBozza1823">Marco Botzaris</persName>,
                    with another man, walked into the Seraglio, a kind of citadel, which had been used as a barrack
                    for the Suliotes, and out of <pb xml:id="JG.308"/> which they had been ejected with difficulty,
                    when it was required for the reception of stores and the establishment of a laboratory. The
                    sentinel ordered them back, but the Suliote advanced. The sergeant of the guard, a German,
                    pushed him back. The Suliote struck the sergeant; they closed and struggled. The Suliote drew
                    his pistol; the German wrenched it from him, and emptied the pan. At this moment a Swedish
                    adventurer, <persName key="LtSass1824">Captain Sass</persName>, seeing the quarrel, ordered the
                    Suliote to be taken to the guard-room. The Suliote would have departed, but the German still
                    held him. The Swede drew his sabre; the Suliote his other pistol. The Swede struck him with the
                    flat of his sword; the Suliote unsheathed his ataghan, and nearly cut off the left arm of his
                    antagonist, and then shot him through the head. The other Suliotes would not deliver up their
                    comrade, for he was celebrated among them for distinguished bravery. The workmen in the
                    laboratory refused to work: they required to be sent home to England, declaring, they had come
                    out to labour peaceably, and not to be exposed to assassination. These untoward occurrences
                    deeply vexed <persName>Byron</persName>, and there was no mind of sufficient energy with him to
                    control the increasing disorders. But, though convinced, as indeed he had been persuaded from
                    the beginning in his own mind, that he could not render any assistance to the cause beyond
                    mitigating the ferocious spirit in which the war was conducted, his pride and honour would not
                    allow him to quit Greece. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap46-5"> In a letter written soon after his first attack, he says, <q>&#8220;I am a
                        good deal better, though of course weakly. The leeches took too much blood from my temples
                        the day after, and there was some difficulty in stopping it; but I have been up daily, and
                        out in boats or on horseback. To-day I have taken a warm bath, and live as temperately as
                        can well be, without any liquid but water, and without any animal food;&#8221; then ad-<pb
                            xml:id="JG.309"/>verting to the turbulences of the Suliotes, he adds, &#8220;but I
                        still hope better things, and will stand by the cause as long as my health and
                        circumstances will permit me to be supposed useful.&#8221; Subsequently, when pressed to
                        leave the marshy and deleterious air of Missolonghi, he replied, still more forcibly,
                        &#8220;I cannot quit Greece while there is a chance of my being of (even supposed) utility.
                        There is a stake worth millions such as I am, and while I can stand at all I must stand by
                        the cause. While I say this, I am aware of the difficulties, and dissensions, and defects
                        of the Greeks themselves; but allowance must be made for them by all reasonable
                        people.&#8221;</q>
                </p>

                <p xml:id="chap46-6"> After this attack of epilepsy <persName key="LdByron">Lord Byron</persName>
                    because disinclined to pursue his scheme against Lepanto. Indeed, it may be said that in his
                    circumstances it was impracticable; for although the Suliotes repented of their
                    insubordination, they yet had an objection to the service, and said &#8220;they would not fight
                    against stone walls.&#8221; All thought of the expedition was in consequence abandoned, and the
                    destinies of poor <persName>Byron</persName> were hastening to their consummation. He began to
                    complain! </p>

                <p xml:id="chap46-7"> In speaking to <persName key="WiParry1859">Parry</persName> one day of the
                    Greek Committee in London, he said, <q>&#8220;I have been grossly ill-treated by the Committee.
                        In Italy <persName key="EdBlaqu1832">Mr. Blaquiere</persName>, their agent, informed me
                        that every requisite supply would be forwarded with all despatch. I was disposed to come to
                        Greece, but I hastened my departure in consequence of earnest solicitations. No time was to
                        be lost, I was told, and <persName>Mr. Blaquiere</persName>, instead of waiting on me at
                        his return from Greece, left a paltry note, which gave me no information whatever. If ever
                        I meet with him, I shall not fail to mention my surprise at his conduct; but it has been
                        all of a piece. I wish the acting Committee had had some of the trouble which has fallen on
                        me since my arrival here: they would have been more prompt in their proceedings, and would
                        have known <pb xml:id="JG.310"/> better what the country stood in need of. They would not
                        have delayed the supplies a day nor have sent out German officers, poor fellows, to starve
                        at Missolonghi, but for my assistance. I am a plain man, and cannot comprehend the use of
                        printing-presses to a people who do not read. Here the Committee have sent supplies of
                        maps. I suppose that I may teach the young mountaineers geography. Here are bugle-horns
                        without bugle-men, and it is a chance if we can find anybody in Greece to blow them. Books
                        are sent to people who want guns; they ask for swords, and the Committee give them the
                        lever of a printing-press.</q>

                        she has fallen under their power. All my income shall be spent in her service; but, unless
                        driven by some great necessity, I will not touch a farthing of the sum intended for my
                        sister&#8217;s children. Whatever I can accomplish with my income, and my personal
                        exertions, shall be cheerfully done. When Greece is secure against external enemies, I will
                        leave the Greeks to settle their government as they like. One service more, and an eminent
                        service it will be, I think I may perform for them. You, <persName key="WiParry1859"
                            >Parry</persName>, shall have a schooner built for me, or I will buy a vessel; the
                        Greeks shall invest me with the character of their ambassador, or agent: I will go to the
                        United States, and procure that free and enlightened government to set the example of
                        recognising the federation of Greece as an independent state. This done, England must
                        follow the example, and then the fate of Greece will be permanently fixed, and she will
                        enter into all her rights as a member of the great commonwealth of Christian Europe.&#8221;

                    to heroism. But as it was, it has only served to show that his mind had suffered by the
                    decadency of his circumstances, and how much the idea of self-exaltation weakly entered into
                    all his plans. The business was secondary to the style in which it should be performed.
                    Building a vessel! why think of the conveyance at all? as if the means of going to America were
                    so scarce that there might be difficulty in finding them. But his mind was passing from him.
                    The intention was unsound&#8212;a fantasy&#8212;a dream of bravery in old age&#8212;begotten of
                    the erroneous supposition that the cabinets of Christendom would remain unconcerned spectators
                    of the triumph of the Greeks, or even of any very long procrastination of their struggle. </p>

                <l rend="head2"> The last illness and death of <persName>Lord Byron</persName>.&#8212;His last
                    poem. </l>

                <p xml:id="chap47-1">
                    <hi rend="small-caps">Although</hi> in common parlance it may be said, that after the attack of
                    epilepsy <persName key="LdByron">Lord Byron&#8217;s</persName> general health did not appear to
                    have been essentially impaired, the appearance was fallacious; his constitution had received a
                    vital shock, and the exciting causes, vexation and confusion, continued to exasperate his
                    irritation. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap47-2"> On the 1st of March he complained of frequent vertigoes, which made him feel
                    as though he were intoxicated; but no effectual means were taken to remove these portentous
                    symptoms; and he regularly enjoyed his daily exercise, sometimes in boats, but oftener on
                    horseback. His physician thought him convalescent; his mind, however, was in constant
                    excitement; it rested not even during sleep. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap47-3"> On the 9th of April, while sailing, he was overtaken by the rain, and got
                    very wet: on his return home, he changed the whole of his dress; but he had been too long in
                    his wet clothes, and the stamina of his constitution being shaken could not withstand the
                    effects. In little more than two hours he was seized with rigors, fever, and rheumatic pains.
                    During the night, however, he slept in his accustomed manner, but in the morning he complained
                    of pains and headache; still this did not prevent him from <pb xml:id="JG.313"/> going out on
                    horseback in the afternoon&#8212;it was for the last time. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap47-4"> On returning home, he observed to one of the servants that the saddle was not
                    perfectly dry, from having been so wet the day before, and that he thought it had made him
                    worse. He soon after became affected with almost constant shivering; sudorific medicines were
                    administered, and blood-letting proposed; but though he took the drugs, he objected to the
                    bleeding. Another physician was in consequence called in to see if the rheumatic fever could be
                    appeased without the loss of blood. This doctor approved of the medicines prescribed, and was
                    not opposed to the opinion that bleeding was necessary, but said it might be deferred till the
                    next day. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap47-5"> On the 11th he seemed rather better, but the medicines had produced no
                    effect. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap47-6"> On the 12th he was confined to bed with fever, and his illness appeared to be
                    increasing; he was very low, and complained of not having had any sleep during the night; but
                    the medical gentlemen saw no cause for alarm. <persName key="FrBruno1828">Dr. Bruno</persName>,
                    his own physician, again proposed bleeding; the stranger still, however, thought it might be
                    deferred, and <persName key="LdByron">Byron</persName> himself was opposed to it. <q>&#8220;You
                        will die,&#8221; said <persName>Dr. Bruno</persName>, &#8220;if you do not allow yourself
                        to be bled.&#8221;</q>
                    <q>&#8220;You wish to get the reputation of curing my disease,&#8221; replied his Lordship,
                        &#8220;that is why you tell me it is so serious; but I will not permit you to bleed
                        me.&#8221;</q>
                </p>

                <p xml:id="chap47-7"> On the 13th he sat up for some time, after a sleepless night, and still
                    complained of pain in his bones and head. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap47-8"> On the 14th he also left his bed. The fever was less, but the debility
                    greater, and the pain in his head was undiminished. His valet became alarmed, and, doubtful of
                    the skill of the doctors around him, entreated permission to send to Zante for an <persName
                        key="DrThoma1824">English physician</persName> of greater reputation. His Lordship desired
                        <pb xml:id="JG.314"/> him to consult the others, which he did, and they told him there was
                    no occasion to call in any person, as they hoped all would be well in a few days. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap47-9"> His Lordship now began to doubt if his disease was understood, and remarked
                    repeatedly in the course of this day, that he was sure the doctors did not understand it.<q>
                        &#8220;Then, my Lord,&#8221; said <persName key="WiFletc1831">Fletcher</persName>, his
                        valet, &#8220;have other advice.&#8221;</q>
                    <q>&#8220;They tell me,&#8221; rejoined his Lordship, &#8220;that it is only a common cold,
                        which you know I have had a thousand times.&#8221;</q>
                </p>

                <p xml:id="chap47-10">
                    <q> &#8220;I am sure you never had one of so serious a nature.&#8221; </q>
                </p>

                <p xml:id="chap47-11">
                    <q> &#8220;I think I never had.&#8221; </q>
                </p>

                <p xml:id="chap47-12">
                    <persName key="WiFletc1831">Fletcher</persName> then went again to the physicians, and repeated
                    his solicitations that the doctor in Zante might be sent for; but was again assured that his
                    master would be better in two or three days. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap47-13"> At length, the doctor who had too easily consented to the postponement of
                    the bleeding, seeing the prognostications of <persName key="FrBruno1828">Dr. Bruno</persName>
                    more and more confirmed, urged the necessity of bleeding, and of no longer delay. This
                    convinced <persName key="LdByron">Byron</persName>, who was himself greatly averse to the
                    operation, that they did not understand his case. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap47-14"> On the 15th his Lordship felt the pains abated, insomuch that he was able to
                    transact some business. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap47-15"> On the 16th he wrote a letter, but towards the evening he became worse, and
                    a pound of blood was taken from him. Still the disease was making progress, but Dr Bruno did
                    not yet seem much alarmed; on the contrary, he thought were more blood removed his recovery was
                    certain. Fletcher immediately told his master, urging him to comply with the doctor&#8217;s
                    wishes. &#8220;I fear,&#8221; said his Lordship, &#8220;they know nothing about my disorder,
                    but&#8221;&#8212;and he stretched out his arm&#8212;&#8220;here, take my arm and do whatever
                    you like.&#8221; </p>

                <p xml:id="chap47-16"> On the 17th his countenance was changed; during <pb xml:id="JG.315"/> the
                    night he had become weaker, and a slight degree of delirium, in which he raved of fighting, had
                    come on. In the course of the day he was bled twice; in the morning, and at two in the
                    afternoon. The bleeding, on both occasions, was followed by fainting fits. On this day he said
                    to <persName key="WiFletc1831">Fletcher</persName>, <q>&#8220;I cannot sleep, and you well know
                        I have not been able to sleep for more than a week. I know that a man can only be a certain
                        time without sleep, and then he must go mad, without anyone being able to save him; and I
                        would ten times sooner shoot myself than be mad, for I am not afraid of dying&#8212;I am
                        more fit to die than people think.&#8221;</q>
                </p>

                <p xml:id="chap47-17"> On the 18th his Lordship first began to dread that his fate was inevitable.
                        <q>&#8220;I fear,&#8221; said he to <persName key="WiFletc1831">Fletcher</persName>,
                        &#8220;you and <persName key="GiFalci1874">Tita</persName> will be ill by sitting up
                        constantly, night and day;&#8221;</q> and he appeared much dissatisfied with his medical
                    treatment. Fletcher again entreated permission to send for <persName key="DrThoma1824">Dr.
                        Thomas</persName>, at Zante: <q>&#8220;Do so, but be quick,&#8221; said his Lordship,
                        &#8220;I am sorry I did not let you do so before, as I am sure they have mistaken my
                        disease; write yourself, for I know they would not like to see other doctors
                        here.&#8221;</q>
                </p>

                <p xml:id="chap47-18"> Not a moment was lost in executing the order, and on <persName
                        key="WiFletc1831">Fletcher</persName> informing the doctors what he had done, they said it
                    was right, as they now began to be afraid themselves. <q>&#8220;Have you sent?&#8221;</q> said
                    his Lordship, when <persName>Fletcher</persName> returned to him.&#8212;<q>&#8220;I have, my
                        Lord.&#8221;</q>
                </p>

                <p xml:id="chap47-19">
                    <q> &#8220;You have done well, for I should like to know what is the matter with me.&#8221;
                    </q>
                </p>

                <p xml:id="chap47-20"> From that time his Lordship grew every hour weaker and weaker; and he had
                    occasional flights of delirium. In the intervals he was, however, quite self-possessed, and
                    said to <persName key="WiFletc1831">Fletcher</persName>, <q>&#8220;I now begin to think I am
                        seriously ill; and in case I should be taken off suddenly, I wish to give you several
                        directions, which I hope you will be particular in seeing executed.&#8221;</q>
                    <persName>Fletcher</persName> in reply expressed his hope that he would <pb xml:id="JG.316"/>
                    live many years, and execute them himself. <q>&#8220;No, it is now nearly over; I must tell you
                        all without losing a moment.&#8221;</q>
                </p>

                <p xml:id="chap47-21">
                    <q> &#8220;Shall I go, my Lord, and fetch pen, ink, and paper.&#8221; </q>
                </p>

                <p xml:id="chap47-22">
                    <q> &#8220;Oh, my God! no, you will lose too much time, and I have it not to spare, for my time
                        is now short. Now pay attention&#8212;you will be provided for.&#8221; </q>
                </p>

                <p xml:id="chap47-23">
                    <q> &#8220;I beseech you, my Lord, to proceed with things of more consequence.&#8221; </q>
                </p>

                <p xml:id="chap47-24"> His Lordship then added, </p>

                <p xml:id="chap47-25">
                    <q> &#8220;Oh, my poor dear child!&#8212;my dear <persName key="AdByron1852"
                        >Ada</persName>!&#8212;My God! could I have but seen her&#8212;give her my
                        blessing&#8212;and my dear sister <persName key="AuLeigh1851">Augusta</persName>, and her
                        children&#8212;and you will go to <persName key="LyByron">Lady Byron</persName> and
                        say&#8212;tell her everything&#8212;you are friends with her.&#8221; </q>
                </p>

                <p xml:id="chap47-26"> He appeared to be greatly affected at this moment. His voice failed, and
                    only words could be caught at intervals; but he kept muttering something very seriously for
                    some time, and after raising his voice, said, </p>

                <p xml:id="chap47-27">
                    <q> &#8220;<persName key="WiFletc1831">Fletcher</persName>, now if you do not execute every
                        order which I have given you, I will torment you hereafter, if possible.&#8221; </q>
                </p>

                <p xml:id="chap47-28"> This little speech is the last characteristic expression which escaped from
                    the dying man. He knew <persName key="WiFletc1831">Fletcher&#8217;s</persName> superstitious
                    tendency, and it cannot be questioned that the threat was the last feeble flash of his
                    prankfulness. The faithful valet replied in consternation that he had not understood one word
                    of what his Lordship had been saying. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap47-29">
                    <q> &#8220;Oh! my God!&#8221; was the reply, &#8220;then all is lost, for it is now too late!
                        Can it be possible you have not understood me!&#8221; </q>
                </p>

                <p xml:id="chap47-30">
                    <q> &#8220;No, my Lord; but I pray you to try and inform me once more.&#8221; </q>
                </p>

                <p xml:id="chap47-31">
                    <q> &#8220;How can I? it is now too late, and all is over.&#8221; </q>
                </p>

                <p xml:id="chap47-32">
                    <q> &#8220;Not our will, but God&#8217;s be done,&#8221;</q> said <persName key="WiFletc1831"
                        >Fletcher</persName>, and his Lordship made another effort, saying, </p>

                <pb xml:id="JG.317"/>


                <p xml:id="chap47-33">
                    <q>&#8220;Yes, not mine be done&#8212;but I will try&#8221;</q>&#8212;and he made several
                    attempts to speak, but could only repeat two or three words at a time; such as, </p>

                <p xml:id="chap47-34">
                    <q>&#8220;My wife! my child&#8212;my sister&#8212;you know all&#8212;you must say all&#8212;you
                        know my wishes&#8221;</q>&#8212;&#8212;The rest was unintelligible. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap47-35"> A consultation with three other doctors, in addition to the two physicians
                    in regular attendance, was now held; and they appeared to think the disease was changing from
                    inflammatory diathesis to languid, and ordered stimulants to be administered. <persName
                        key="FrBruno1828">Dr. Bruno</persName> opposed this with the greatest warmth; and pointed
                    out that the symptoms were those, not of an alteration in the disease, but of a fever flying to
                    the brain, which was violently attacked by it; and, that the stimulants they proposed would
                    kill more speedily than the disease itself. While, on the other hand, by copious bleeding, and
                    the medicines that had been taken before, he might still be saved. The other physicians,
                    however, were of a different opinion; and then <persName>Dr. Bruno</persName> declared he would
                    risk no farther responsibility. Peruvian bark and wine were then administered. After taking

                <p xml:id="chap47-36"> For four-and-twenty hours he continued in a state of lethargy, with the

                    who was watching by his bed-side, saw him open his eyes and then shut them, apparently without
                    pain or moving hand or foot. <q>&#8220;My God!&#8221; exclaimed the faithful valet, &#8220;I

                    by all Greece as a national misfortune. From the moment it was known that fears were
                    entertained for his life, the progress of the disease was watched with the deepest anxiety and
                    sorrow. On Easter Sunday, the day on which he expired, thousands of the inhabitants of
                    Missolonghi had assembled on the spacious plain on the outside of the city, according to an
                    ancient custom, to exchange the salutations of the morning; but on this occasion it was
                    remarked, that instead of the wonted congratulations, &#8220;Christ is risen,&#8221; they
                    inquired first, &#8220;How is <persName>Lord Byron</persName>?&#8221; </p>

                    and others, that the interment should be in Zante; but the English opposed the proposition in
                    the most decided manner. It was then suggested that it should be conveyed to Athens, and
                    deposited in the temple of Theseus, or in the Parthenon&#8212;<persName key="Odysseus">Ulysses

                    vessel engaged to carry them to London, in the expectation that they would be deposited in
                    Westminster Abbey or St Paul&#8217;s. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap48-6"> On the 25th of May, the Florida left Zante with the body, which <persName

                    the Downs. After the ship was cleared from quarantine, <persName key="JoHobho1869">Mr.
                        Hobhouse</persName>, with his Lordship&#8217;s solicitor, received it from
                        <persName>Colonel Stanhope</persName>, and, by their directions it was removed to the house
                    of <persName key="EdKnatc1849">Sir E. Knatchbull</persName>, in Westminster, where it lay in
                    state several days. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap48-7"> The dignitaries of the Abbey and of St. Paul&#8217;s having, as it was said,
                    refused permission to deposit the remains in either of these great national receptacles of the
                    illustrious dead, it was determined that they should be laid in the ancestral vault of the
                        <persName>Byrons</persName>. The funeral, instead of being public, was in consequence
                    private, and attended by only a few select friends to Hucknell, a small village about two miles
                    from Newstead Abbey, in the church of which the vault is situated; there the <pb

                    poet, that his dust might be mingled with his mother&#8217;s. Yet, unmeet and plain as the
                    solemnity was in its circumstances, a remarkable incident gave it interest and distinction: as
                    it passed along the streets of London, a sailor was observed walking uncovered near the hearse,
                    and on being asked what he was doing there, replied that he had served <persName key="LdByron"
                        >Lord Byron</persName> in the Levant, and had come to pay his last respects to his remains;
                    a simple but emphatic testimony to the sincerity of that regard which his Lordship often
                    inspired, and which with more steadiness might always have commanded. </p>

                <l rend="head2"> The character of <persName>Lord Byron</persName>. </l>

                <p xml:id="chap49-1">
                    <hi rend="small-caps">My</hi> endeavour, in the foregoing pages, has been to give a general
                    view of the intellectual character of <persName key="LdByron">Lord Byron</persName>. It did not
                    accord with the plan to enter minutely into the details of his private life, which I suspect
                    was not greatly different from that of any other person of his rank, not distinguished for
                    particular severity of manners. In some respects his Lordship was, no doubt, peculiar. He
                    possessed a vivacity of sensibility not common, and talents of a very extraordinary kind. He
                    was also distinguished for superior personal elegance, particularly in his bust. The style and
                    character of his head were universally admired; but perhaps the beauty of his physiognomy has
                    been more highly spoken of than it really merited. Its chief grace consisted, when he was in a
                    gay humour, of a liveliness which gave a joyous meaning to every articulation of the muscles
                    and features: when he was less agreeably disposed, the expression was morose to a very
                    repulsive degree. It is, however, unnecessary to describe his personal character here. I have
                    already said enough incidentally, to explain my full opinion of it. In the mass, I do not think
                    it was calculated to attract much permanent affection or esteem. In the detail it was the
                    reverse: few men possessed more companionable qualities than <persName>Lord Byron</persName>
                    did occa-<pb xml:id="JG.325"/>sionally; and seen at intervals in those felicitous moments, I
                    imagine it would have been difficult to have said, that a more interesting companion had been
                    previously met with. But he was not always in that fascinating state of pleasantry: he was as
                    often otherwise; and no two individuals could be more distinct from each other than
                        <persName>Byron</persName> in his gaiety and in his misanthropy. This antithesis was the
                    great cause of that diversity of opinion concerning him, which has so much divided his friends
                    and adversaries. Of his character as a poet there can be no difference of opinion, but only a
                    difference in the degree of admiration. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap49-2"> Excellence in talent, as in every other thing, is comparative; but the
                    universal republic of letters will acknowledge, that in energy of expression and liveliness of
                    imagery <persName key="LdByron">Byron</persName> had no equal in his own time. Doubts, indeed,
                    may be entertained, if in these high qualities even <persName key="WiShake1616"
                        >Shakspeare</persName> himself was his superior. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap49-3"> I am not disposed to think with many of those who rank the genius of
                        <persName key="LdByron">Byron</persName> almost as supreme, that he has shown less skill in
                    the construction of his plots, and the development of his tales, than might have been expected
                    from one so splendidly endowed; for it has ever appeared to me that he has accomplished in them
                    everything he proposed to attain, and that in this consists one of his great merits. His mind,
                    fervid and impassioned, was in all his compositions, except <name type="title"
                        key="LdByron.Juan">Don Juan</name>, eagerly fixed on the catastrophe. He ever held the goal
                    full in view, and drove to it in the most immediate manner. By this straightforward simplicity
                    all the interest which intricacy excites was of necessity disregarded. He is therefore not
                    treated justly when it is supposed that he might have done better had he shown more art: the
                    wonder is, that he should have produced such magnificent effects with so little. He could not
                    have made the satiated and meditative <pb xml:id="JG.326"/>
                    <persName type="fiction">Harold</persName> so darkling and excursive, so lone,
                    &#8220;aweary,&#8221; and misanthropical, had he treated him as the hero of a scholastic epic.
                    The might of the poet in such creations lay in the riches of his diction and in the felicity
                    with which he described feelings in relation to the aspect of scenes amid the reminiscences
                    with which the scenes themselves were associated. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap49-4"> If in language and plan he be so excellent, it may be asked why should he not
                    be honoured with that pre-eminent niche in the temple which so many in the world have by
                    suffrage assigned to him? Simply because, with all the life and beauty of his style, the vigour
                    and truth of his descriptions, the boldness of his conceptions, and the reach of his vision in
                    the dark abysses of passion, <persName key="LdByron">Lord Byron</persName> was but imperfectly
                    acquainted with human nature. He looked but on the outside of man. No characteristic action
                    distinguishes one of his heroes from another, nor is there much dissimilarity in their
                    sentiments; they have no individuality; they stalk and pass in mist and gloom, grim, ghastly,
                    and portentous, mysterious shadows, entities of the twilight, weird things like the sceptred
                    effigies of the unborn issue of <persName type="fiction">Banquo</persName>. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap49-5"> Combined with vast power, <persName key="LdByron">Lord Byron</persName>
                    possessed, beyond all question, the greatest degree of originality of any poet of this age. In
                    this rare quality he has no parallel in any age. All other poets and inventive authors are
                    measured in their excellence by the accuracy with which they fit sentiments appropriate not
                    only to the characters they create, but to the situations in which they place them: the works
                    of <persName>Lord Byron</persName> display the opposite to this, and with the most
                    extraordinary splendour. He endows his creations with his own qualities; he finds in the
                    situations in which he places them only opportunities to express what he has himself felt or
                    suffered; and yet he mixes so much probability in the circumstances, that they are always
                    eloquently proper. He does every <pb xml:id="JG.327"/> thing, as it were, the reverse of other
                    poets; in the air and sea, which have been in all times the emblems of change and the
                    similitudes of inconstancy, he has discovered the very principles of permanency. The ocean in
                    his view, not by its vastness, its unfathomable depths, and its limitless extent, becomes an
                    image of deity, by its unchangeable character! </p>

                <p xml:id="chap49-6"> The variety of his productions present a prodigious display of power. In his
                    short career he has entitled himself to be ranked in the first class of the British poets for
                    quantity alone. By <name key="LdByron.Harold">Childe Harold</name>, and his other poems of the
                    same mood, he has extended the scope of feeling, made us acquainted with new trains of
                    association, awakened sympathies which few suspected themselves of possessing; and he has laid
                    open darker recesses in the bosom than were previously supposed to exist. The deep and dreadful
                    caverns of remorse had long been explored; but he was the first to visit the bottomless pit of
                    satiety. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap49-7"> The delineation of that Promethean fortitude which defied conscience, as he
                    has shown it in <name key="LdByron.Manfred">Manfred</name>, is his greatest achievement. The
                    terrific fables of <persName key="ChMarlo1593">Marlowe</persName> and of <persName
                        key="JoGoeth1832">Go&#235;the</persName>, in their respective versions of the legend of
                        <persName type="fiction">Faustus</persName>, had disclosed the utmost writhings which
                    remorse in the fiercest of its torments can express; but what are those <persName
                        type="fiction">Laocoon</persName> agonies to the sublime serenity of <persName
                        type="fiction">Manfred</persName>. In the power, the originality, and the genius combined,
                    of that unexampled performance, <persName key="LdByron">Lord Byron</persName> has placed
                    himself on an equality with <persName key="JoMilto1674">Milton</persName>. The <persName
                        type="fiction">Satan</persName> of the <name type="title" key="JoMilto1674.Paradise"
                        >Paradise Lost</name> is animated by motives, and dignified by an eternal enterprise. He
                    hath purposes of infinite prospect to perform, and an immeasurable ambition to satisfy.
                        <persName type="fiction">Manfred</persName> hath neither purpose nor ambition, nor any
                    desire that seeks gratification. He hath done a deed which severs him from hope, as
                    everlastingly as the apostacy with the angels has done Satan. He acknowledges no contrition to
                    bespeak <pb xml:id="JG.328"/> commiseration, he complains of no wrong to justify revenge, for
                    he feels none; he despises sympathy, and almost glories in his perdition. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap49-8"> The creation of such a character is in the sublimest degree of originality;
                    to give it appropriate thoughts and feelings required powers worthy of the conception; and to
                    make it susceptible of being contemplated as within the scope and range of human sympathy,
                    places <persName key="LdByron">Byron</persName> above all his contemporaries and antecedents.
                        <persName key="JoMilto1674">Milton</persName> has described in <persName type="fiction"
                        >Satan</persName> the greatest of human passions, supernatural attributes, directed to
                    immortal intents, and stung with inextinguishable revenge; but <persName type="fiction"
                        >Satan</persName> is only a dilatation of man. <persName type="fiction">Manfred</persName>
                    is loftier, and worse than <persName type="fiction">Satan</persName>; he has conquered
                    punishment, having within himself a greater than hell can inflict. There is a fearful mystery
                    in this conception; it is only by solemnly questioning the spirits that lurk within the dark
                    metaphors in which <persName type="fiction">Manfred</persName> expresses himself, that the
                    hideous secrets of the character can be conjectured. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap49-9"> But although in intellectual power, and in creative originality, <persName
                        key="LdByron">Byron</persName> is entitled to stand on the highest peak of the mountain,
                    his verse is often so harsh, and his language so obscure, that in the power of delighting he is
                    only a poet of the second class. He had all the talent and the means requisite to embody his
                    conceptions in a manner worthy of their might and majesty; his treasury was rich in everything
                    rare and beautiful for illustration, but he possessed not the instinct requisite to guide him
                    in the selection of the things necessary to the inspiration of delight:&#8212;he could give his
                    statue life and beauty, and warmth, and motion, and eloquence, but not a tuneful voice. </p>

                <p xml:id="chap49-10"> Some curious metaphysicians, in their subtle criticism, have said that <name
                        type="title" key="LdByron.Juan">Don Juan</name> was but the bright side of <name
                        type="title" key="LdByron.Harold">Childe Harold</name>, and that all its most brilliant
                    imagery was similar to that of which the dark and the shadows were delineated in his other
                    works. It may be so. <pb xml:id="JG.329"/> And, without question, a great similarity runs
                    through everything that has come from the poet&#8217;s pen; but it is a family resemblance, the
                    progeny are all like one another; but where are those who are like them? I know of no author in
                    prose or rhyme, in the English language, with whom <persName key="LdByron">Byron</persName> can
                    be compared. Imitators of his manner there will be often and many, but he will ever remain one
                    of the few whom the world acknowledges are alike supreme, and yet unlike each
                    other&#8212;epochal characters, who mark extraordinary periods in history. </p>

                        <q> &#8220;A young lady of considerable talents, but who had never been able to succeed in
                            turning them to any profitable account, was reduced to great hardships through the
                            misfortunes of her family. The only persons from whom she could have hoped for relief
                            were abroad; and urged on, more by the sufferings of those she held dear, than by her
                            own, summoned up resolution to wait on <persName key="LdByron">Lord Byron</persName> at
                            his apartments in the Albany, and solicit his subscription to a volume of poems: she
                            had no previous knowledge of him, except from his works; but from the boldness and
                            feeling expressed in them, she concluded that he must be <pb xml:id="JG.332"/> a man of
                            a kind heart and amiable disposition. She entered the apartment with diffidence, but
                            soon found courage to state her request, which she did with simplicity and delicacy. He
                            listened with attention; and when she had done speaking, he, as if to divert her
                            thoughts from a subject which could not but be painful to her, began to converse with
                            her in words so fascinating, and tones so gentle, that she hardly perceived he had been
                            writing, until he put a slip of paper into her hand, saying it was his subscription,
                            and that he most heartily wished her success.&#8212;<q>&#8216;But,&#8217; added he,
                                &#8216;we are both young, and the world is very censorious; and so if I were to
                                take any active part in procuring subscribers to your poems, I fear it would do you
                                harm, rather than good.&#8217;</q> The young lady, overpowered by the prudence and
                            delicacy of his conduct, took her leave; and upon opening the paper in the street,
                            which in her agitation she had not previously looked at, she found it was a draft upon

                            several times involved himself and his master in perplexity and trouble by his
                            unrestrained attachment to women. In Greece this had been very annoying, and induced
                                <persName>Lord Byron</persName> to think of a means of curing it. A young Suliote
                            of the guard was accordingly dressed up like a woman, and instructed to place himself
                            in the way of the amorous swain. The bait took, and after some communication, but
                            rather by signs than by words, for the pair did not understand each other&#8217;s
                            language, the sham lady was carefully conducted by the gallant to one of <persName>Lord

                            Suliote, a husband provided for the occasion, accompanied by half a dozen of his
                            comrades, whose presence and threats terrified the poor lackey almost out of his
                            senses. The noise of course brought <persName>Lord Byron</persName> to the spot to
                            laugh at the tricked serving-man, and rescue him from the effects of his

                        <q> &#8220;The regiment, or rather brigade we formed, can be described only as <persName
                                key="LdByron">Byron</persName> himself describes it. There was a Greek tailor, who
                            had been in the British service in the Ionian islands, where he had married an Italian
                            woman. This lady, knowing something of the military service, petitioned <persName>Lord
                                Byron</persName> to appoint her husband master-tailor of the brigade. The
                            suggestion was useful, and this part of her petition was immediately granted. At the
                            same time, however, she solicited that she might be permitted to raise a corps of women
                            to be placed under her orders, to accompany the regiment. She stipulated for free
                            quarters and rations for them, but rejected all claim for pay. They were to be free of
                            all encumbrances, and were to wash, sew, cook, and otherwise provide for the men. The
                            proposition pleased <persName>Lord Byron</persName>, and stating the matter to me, he
                            said he hoped I should have no objection. I had been accustomed to see women accompany
                            the English army, and I knew that though sometimes an encumbrance, they were on the
                            whole more beneficial than otherwise. In Greece there were many circumstances which
                            would make their services extremely valuable, and I gave my consent to the measure. The
                            tailor&#8217;s wife did accordingly recruit a considerable number of unencumbered
                            women, of almost all nations, but principally Greeks, Italians, Maltese, and ne-<pb

                        <q> &#8220;<persName key="LdByron">Lord Byron</persName> had a black groom with him in
                            Greece, an American by birth, to whom he was very partial. He always insisted on this
                            man&#8217;s calling him massa, whenever he spoke to him. On one occasion, the groom met
                            with two women of his own complexion, who had been slaves to the Turks and liberated,
                            but had been left almost to starve when the Greeks had risen on their tyrant. Being of
                            the same colour was a bond of sympathy between them and the groom, and he applied to me
                            to give both these women quarters in the seraglio. I granted the application, and
                            mentioned it to <persName>Lord Byron</persName>, who laughed at the gallantry of his
                            groom and ordered that he should be brought before him at ten o&#8217;clock the next
                            day, to answer for his presumption in making such an application. At ten o&#8217;clock
                            accordingly he attended his master, with great trembling and fear, but stuttered so
                            when he attempted to speak, that he could not make himself understood. <persName>Lord
                                Byron</persName>, endeavouring almost in vain to preserve his gravity, reproved him
                            severely for his presumption. Blacky stuttered a thousand excuses, and was ready to do
                            any thing to appease his massa&#8217;s anger. His great yellow eyes wide open, he
                            trembling from head to foot, his wandering and stuttering excuses, his visible dread,
                            all tended to provoke laughter, and <persName>Lord Byron</persName> fearing his own
                            dignity <pb xml:id="JG.340"/> would be hove overboard, told him to hold his tongue and
                            listen to his sentence. I was commanded to enter it in his memorandum-book, and then he
                            pronounced it in a solemn tone of voice, while blacky stood aghast, expecting some
                            severe punishment, the following doom: <q> &#8216;My determination is, that the
                                children born of these black women, of which you may be the father, shall be my

                            stuttered out the groom, and sallied forth to tell the good news to the two distressed

                                Byron&#8217;s</persName> own carriage with post-horses; and he sent his groom with
                            two saddle-horses, and a beautifully-formed, very ferocious bull-mastiff, called <name
                                type="animal">Nelson</name>, to meet us there. <name type="animal">Boatswain</name>
                            went by the side of his valet, <persName>Frank</persName>, on the box with us. The
                            bull-dog <name type="animal">Nelson</name> always wore a muzzle, and was occasionally
                            sent for into our private room, when the muzzle was taken off much to my annoyance, and
                            he and his master amused themselves with throwing the room into disorder. There was
                            always a jealous feud between this <name type="animal">Nelson</name> and <name
                                type="animal">Boatswain</name>, and whenever the latter came into the room while
                            the former was there, they instantly seized each other, and then
                                <persName>Byron</persName>, myself, <persName key="FrBoyce1807">Frank</persName>,
                            and all the waiters that could be found, were vigorously engaged in parting them; which
                            was, in general, only effected by thrusting poker and tongs into the mouth of each. But
                            one day <name type="animal">Nelson</name> unfortunately escaped out of the room without
                            his muzzle, and, going into the stable-yard, fastened upon the throat of a horse, from
                            which he could not be disengaged. The stable-boys ran in alarm to find
                                <persName>Frank</persName>, who, taking one of his Lordship&#8217;s

                            of spirit, which might well win for him the affections of such a master as <persName
                                key="LdByron">Byron</persName>. One of these I shall endeavour to relate, as nearly
                            as possible as it was told to me. <persName key="CaByron1811">Mrs. Byron</persName> had
                            a fox-terrier called <name type="animal">Gilpin</name>, with whom her son&#8217;s dog
                                <name type="animal">Boatswain</name> was perpetually at war, taking every
                            opportunity of attacking and worrying him so violently, that it was very much
                            apprehended he would kill the animal. <persName>Mrs. Byron</persName>, therefore, sent
                            off her terrier to a tenant at Newstead, and on the departure of <persName>Lord
                                Byron</persName> for Cambridge, his friend <name type="animal">Boatswain</name>,
                            with two other dogs, was intrusted to the care of a servant till his return. One
                            morning the servant was much alarmed by the disappearance of <name type="animal"
                                >Boatswain</name>, and throughout the whole of the day he could hear no tidings of
                            him. At last, towards evening, the stray dog arrived, accompanied by <name
                                type="animal">Gilpin</name>, whom he led immediately to the kitchen fire, licking
                            him, and lavishing upon him every possible demonstration of joy. The fact was, he had
                            been all the way to Newstead to fetch him, and having now established his former foe
                            under the roof once more agreed so perfectly well with him ever after, that he even
                            protected him against the insults of other dogs (a task which the quarrelsomeness of
                            the little terrier rendered no sinecure); and if he but heard <name type="animal"

                            were, from first to last, the ruling stars of his destiny. The fear of becoming what he
                            was naturally inclined to be, enormously fat, had induced him, from his first entrance
                            at Cambridge, to adopt, for the purpose of reducing himself, a system of violent
                            exercise and abstinence, together with the frequent use of warm baths. But the

                                <p xml:id="app.1.1-1"> &#8220;In 1817, a few young people met every evening at the
                                    Theatre de la Scala, at Milan, in the box of <persName key="LoBreme1820"
                                        >Monsignor Ludovic de Br&#234;me</persName>, formerly chief almoner of the
                                    ex-king of Italy. This Italian custom, not generally followed in France,
                                    banished all ceremony. The affectation that chills the atmosphere of a French
                                    saloon is unknown in the society of Milan. How is it possible that such a
                                    sentiment can find a place amongst individuals in the habit of seeing each
                                    other above three hundred times in the course of a twelve-month? One evening, a
                                    stranger made his appearance in <persName>Monsignor de
                                        Br&#234;me&#8217;s</persName> box. He was young, of middling stature, and
                                    with remarkably fine eyes. As he advanced, we observed that he limped a little.
                                        <persName>&#8216;Gentlemen,&#8217; said <persName>Monsignor de
                                            Br&#234;me</persName>, &#8216;this is <persName key="LdByron">Lord
                                            Byron</persName>.&#8217;</persName> We were afterwards presented to his
                                    Lordship, the whole scene passing with as much ceremonious gravity, as if our
                                    introducer had been <persName>De Br&#234;me&#8217;s</persName> grandfather, in
                                    days of yore ambassador from the Duke of Savoy to the court of <persName
                                        key="Louis14">Louis XIV</persName>. Aware of the character of the English,
                                    who generally avoid such as appear to court their society, we cautiously
                                    abstained from conversing with, or even looking at, <persName>Lord
                                        Byron</persName>. The latter had been informed, that <pb xml:id="JG.348"/>
                                    in the course of the evening he would probably be introduced to a stranger who
                                    had performed the celebrated campaign of Moscow, which still possessed the
                                    charm of novelty, as at that time we had not been spoiled by any romances on
                                    the subject. A fine-looking man, with a military appearance, happening to be of
                                    our party, his Lordship naturally concluded that he was the hero; and
                                    accordingly, in addressing him, relaxed considerably from the natural coldness
                                    of his manner. The next day, however, <persName>Byron</persName> was
                                    undeceived. Changing his battery, he did me the honour to address me on the
                                    subject of Russia. I idolized <persName key="Napoleon1">Napoleon</persName>,
                                    and replied to his Lordship as I should have done to a member of the
                                    legislative assembly who had exiled the ex-emperor to St. Helena. I
                                    subsequently discovered, that <persName>Lord Byron</persName> was at once
                                    enthusiastic in favour of <persName>Napoleon</persName>, and jealous of his
                                    fame. He used to say, <q>&#8216;Napoleon and myself are the only individuals
                                        who sign our names with the initials N. B.&#8217;</q> (<persName>Noel
                                        Byron</persName>.) My determination to be cold offers some explanation for
                                    the marked kindness with which, at the end of a few days, <persName>Lord
                                        Byron</persName> did me the favour to regard me. Our friends in the box
                                    imagined, that the discussion which had taken place, and which, though polite
                                    and respectful on my part, had been rather warm, would prevent all further
                                    intimacy between us. They were mistaken. The next evening, his Lordship took me
                                    by the arm, and walked with me for an hour in the saloon of the Theatre de la
                                    Scala. I was gratified with his politeness, for which, at the bottom, I was
                                    indebted to his desire of conversing with an eyewitness on the subject of the
                                    Russian campaign. He even closely cross-questioned me on this point. However, a
                                    second reading of <name type="title" key="LdByron.Harold">Childe Harold</name>
                                    made amends for all. His progress in the good graces of my Italian friends, who
                                    met every evening in <persName>Monsignor de Br&#234;me&#8217;s</persName> box,
                                    was not very rapid. <pb xml:id="JG.349"/> I must confess, that his Lordship,
                                    one evening, broached rather a whimsical idea&#8212;that, in a discussion which
                                    had just been started, his title added weight to his opinion. On that occasion,
                                        <persName>De Br&#234;me</persName> retorted with the well-known anecdote of
                                        <persName key="ChCastr1801">Marshal de Castries</persName>, who, shocked at
                                    the deference once paid to <persName key="JeDAlemb1783"
                                        >D&#8217;Alembert&#8217;s</persName> judgment, exclaimed, <q>&#8216;A
                                        pretty reasoner truly! a fellow not worth three thousand francs
                                        a-year!&#8217;</q> On another evening, <persName>Lord Byron</persName>
                                    afforded an opening to ridicule, by the warmth with which he denied all
                                    resemblance between his own character and that of <persName key="JeRouss1778"
                                        >Jean Jacques Rousseau</persName>, to whom he had been compared. His
                                    principal objection to the comparison, though he would not acknowledge the
                                    fact, was, that <persName>Rousseau</persName> had been a servant, and the son
                                    of a watchmaker. We could not avoid a hearty laugh, when, at the conclusion of
                                    the argument, <persName>Byron</persName> requested from <persName>De
                                        Br&#234;me</persName>, who was allied to the oldest nobility of Turin, some
                                    information relative to the family of <persName>Govon</persName>, in whose
                                    service <persName>Jean Jacques</persName> had actually lived. (See <name
                                        type="title" key="JeRouss1778.Confessions"><hi rend="italic">Les
                                            Confessions</hi></name>.) <persName>Lord Byron</persName> always
                                    entertained a great horror of corpulency. His antipathy to a full habit of body
                                    might be called a fixed idea. <persName key="JoPolid1821">M.
                                        Pollidori</persName>, a young physician who travelled with him, assured us,
                                    that his Lordship&#8217;s mother was of low stature and extremely fat. During
                                    at least a third part of the day, <persName>Byron</persName> was a dandy,
                                    expressed a constant dread of augmenting the bulk of his outward man, concealed
                                    his right foot as much as possible, and endeavoured to render himself agreeable
                                    in female society. His vanity, however, frequently induced him to lose sight of
                                    the end, in his attention to the means. Love was sacrificed;&#8212;an affair of
                                    the heart would have interfered with his daily exercise on horseback. At Milan
                                    and Venice, his fine eyes, his handsome horses, and his fame, gained him the
                                    smiles of several young, noble, and lovely females, one of whom, in particular,
                                    performed <pb xml:id="JG.350"/> a journey of more than a hundred miles for the
                                    pleasure of being present at a masked ball to which his Lordship was invited.
                                    Byron was apprized of the circumstance, but, either from <hi rend="italic"
                                        >hauteur</hi> or shyness, declined an introduction. <q>&#8216;Your poets
                                        are perfect clowns,&#8217;</q> cried the fair one, as she indignantly
                                    quitted the ball-room. Had <persName>Byron</persName> succeeded in his
                                    pretensions to be thought the finest man in England, and had his claims to the
                                    fashionable supremacy been at the same time disputed, he would still have been
                                    unsatisfied. In his moments of dandyism, he always pronounced the name of
                                        <persName key="BeBrumm1840">Brummel</persName> with a mingled emotion of
                                    respect and jealousy. When his personal attractions were not the subject of his
                                    consideration, his noble birth was uppermost in his thoughts. At Milan we often
                                    purposely discussed in his presence the question, &#8216;if <persName
                                        key="Henry4Fr">Henry IV.</persName> could justly pretend to the attribute
                                    of clemency, after having ordered his old companion, the <persName
                                        key="ChBiron1602">Duke de Biron</persName>, to be beheaded?&#8217;
                                            <persName>&#8216;<persName>Napoleon</persName> would have acted
                                        differently,&#8217;</persName> was his Lordship&#8217;s constant reply. It
                                    was ludicrous to observe his respect wavering undecided between acquired
                                    distinction and his own nobility, which he considered far above that of the
                                        <persName>Duke de Biron</persName>. When the pride of birth and personal
                                    vanity no longer usurped undue sway over his mind, he again became the sublime
                                    poet and the man of sense. Never, after the example of <persName
                                        key="GeStael1817">Madame de Sta&#235;l</persName>, did he indulge in
                                    childish vanity of &#8216;turning a phrase.&#8217; When literary subjects were
                                    introduced, <persName>Byron</persName> was exactly the reverse of an
                                    academician; his thoughts flowed with greater rapidity than his words, and his
                                    expressions were free from all affectation or studied grace. Towards midnight,
                                    particularly when the music of the opera had produced an impression on his
                                    feelings, instead of describing them with a view to effect, he yielded
                                    naturally to his emotions, as though he had all his life been an inhabitant of
                                    the south.&#8221; </p>

                                    injurious but to him who has given it birth. It must be admitted, that during

                                    slave, faithless to her vows of love?&#8217; Be this as it may, a great man
                                    once known may be said to have opened an account with posterity. If
                                        <persName>Byron</persName> played the part of <persName type="fiction"
                                        >Othello</persName>, hundreds of witnesses will be found to bear testimony
                                    to the damning deed; and sooner or later posterity will learn whether his
                                    remorse was founded in guilt, or in the affectation of which he has so
                                    frequently been accused. After all, is it not possible that his conscience
                                    might have exaggerated some youthful error? - - - - - One evening, amongst
                                    others, the conversation turned upon a handsome Milanese female, who had
                                    eagerly desired to venture her person in single combat with a lover by whom she
                                    had been abandoned: the discussion afterwards changed to the story of a prince
                                    who in cold blood had murdered his mistress for an act of infidelity.
                                        <persName>Byron</persName> was instantly silent, endeavoured to restrain
                                    his feelings, but, unequal to the effort, soon afterwards indignantly quitted
                                    the box. His indignation on this occasion was evidently directed against the
                                    subject of the anecdote, and in our eyes absolved himself from the suspicion of
                                    a similar offence. Whatever might be the crime of which
                                        <persName>Byron</persName> apparently stood self-accused, I may compare it
                                    to the robbery of a piece of riband, committed by Jean <pb xml:id="JG.352"/>
                                    Jacques <persName key="JeRouss1778">Rousseau</persName> during his stay at
                                    Turin. After the lapse of a few weeks, <persName>Byron</persName> seemed to
                                    have acquired a taste for the society of Milan. When the performances for the
                                    evening were over, we frequently stopped at the door of the theatre to enjoy
                                    the sight of the beauties who passed us in review. Perhaps few cities could
                                    boast such an assemblage of lovely women as that which chance had collected at
                                    Milan in 1817. Many of them had flattered themselves with the idea that
                                        <persName>Byron</persName> would seek an introduction; but whether from
                                    pride, timidity, or a remnant of dandyism, which induced him to do exactly the
                                    contrary of what was expected, he invariably declined that honour. He seemed to
                                    prefer a conversation on poetical or philosophical subjects. At the theatre,
                                    our discussions were frequently so energetical as to rouse the indignation of
                                    the pit. One evening, in the middle of a philosophical argument on the
                                    principle of utility, <persName key="SiPelli1854">Silvio Pellico</persName>, a
                                    delightful poet, who has since died in an Austrian prison, came in breathless
                                    haste to apprize <persName>Lord Byron</persName> that his friend and physician,
                                        <persName key="JoPolid1821">Polidori</persName>, had been arrested. We
                                    instantly ran to the guard-house. It turned out, that
                                        <persName>Polidori</persName> had fancied himself incommoded in the pit by
                                    the fur cap of the officer on guard, and had requested him to take it off,
                                    alleging that it impeded his view of the stage. The poet <persName
                                        key="ViMonti1828">Monti</persName> had accompanied us, and, to the number
                                    of fifteen or twenty, we surrounded the prisoner. Every one spoke at once;
                                        <persName>Polidori</persName> was beside himself with passion, and his face
                                    red as a burning coal. <persName>Byron</persName>, though he too was in a
                                    violent rage, was, on the contrary, pale as ashes. His patrician blood boiled
                                    as he reflected on the slight consideration in which he was held. I have little
                                    doubt but at that moment he regretted the wall of separation which he had
                                    reared between himself and the ultra party. At all events, the Austrian officer
                                    spied the leaven of sedition in our countenances, and, if he was versed in
                                    history, probably thought of the <pb xml:id="JG.353"/> insurrection of Genoa,
                                    in 1740. He ran from the guard-house to call his men, who seized their arms
                                    that had been piled on the outside. <persName>Monti&#8217;s</persName> idea was
                                    excellent; &#8216;<hi rend="italic"><foreign>Fortiamo tutti; restino solamente

                                        Sartirana</persName>, his brother, <persName>Count Confalonieri</persName>,
                                    and <persName>Lord Byron</persName>. These gentlemen having written their names
                                    and titles, the list was handed to the officer on guard, who instantly forgot
                                    the insult offered to his fur cap, and allowed <persName>Polidori</persName> to
                                    leave the guard-house. In the evening, however, the doctor received an order to
                                    quit Milan within twenty–four hours. Foaming with rage, he swore that he would
                                    one day return and bestow manual castigation on the governor who had treated
                                    him with so little respect. He did not return; and two years afterwards a

                                        <persName>Lord Byron</persName>. I repressed the repartee which hovered on
                                    my lips. <persName>Byron</persName> had a defect in common with all the spoiled
                                    children of fortune. He cherished in his bosom two contradictory inclinations.
                                    He wished to be received as a man of rank, and admired as a brilliant poet. The
                                        <name type="title" key="SiMayr1845.Elena">Elena</name> of <persName
                                        key="SiMayr1845">Mayer</persName> was at that time the performance most in
                                    vogue at Milan. The public patiently endured two miserable acts, for the
                                    pleasure of hearing a sublime <foreign><hi rend="italic">sesteto</hi></foreign>
                                    in the third. One day, when it was sung with more than ordinary power, I was
                                    struck with the expression of <persName>Byron&#8217;s</persName> eyes. Never
                                    had I seen any thing so enthusiastic. Internally, I made a vow that I never
                                    would of my own free accord sadden a spirit so noble. In the evening, I
                                    recollect that some one alluded to the following singular sonnet of <persName

                                        of spleen&#8212;nothing more. A belief in the Supreme Being was an absolute
                                        necessity for the tender and warm imagination of <persName
                                            key="ToTasso1595">Tasso</persName>. He was, besides, too much of a
                                        Platonist to connect together the links of a difficult argument. When he
                                        composed that sonnet, he felt the inspiration of his genius, and probably
                                        wanted a morsel of bread and a mistress.&#8217;</q> The house in which
                                        <persName>Lord Byron</persName> resided was situated at the further
                                    extremity of a solitary quarter, at the distance of half a league from the
                                    Theatre de la Scala. The streets of Milan were at that time much infested with
                                    robbers during the night. Some of us, forgetting time and space in the charm of
                                    the poet&#8217;s conversation, generally accompanied him to his own door, and
                                    on our return, at two o&#8217;clock in the morning, were obliged to pass
                                    through a multitude of intricate, suspicious-looking streets. This circumstance
                                    gave an additional air of romance to the noble bard&#8217;s retreat. For my
                                    part, I often wondered that he escaped being laid under contribution. Had it
                                    been otherwise, with his feelings and ideas, he would undoubtedly have felt
                                    peculiarly mortified. The fact is, that the practical jokes played off by the
                                    knights of the road were frequently of the most ludicrous description&#8212;at
                                    least to all but the sufferers. The weather was cold, and the pedestrian,
                                    snugly enveloped in his cloak, was often attacked by some dexterous thief, who,
                                    gliding gently behind him, passed a hoop over his head down to his elbows, and
                                    thus fettered the victim, whom he afterwards pillaged at his leisure. <persName
                                        key="JoPolid1821">Polidori</persName> informed us that
                                        <persName>Byron</persName> often composed a hundred verses in the course of
                                    the morning. On his return from the theatre in the evening, still under the
                                    charm of the music to which he had listened, he would take up his papers, and
                                    reduce his hundred verses to five-and-twenty or thirty. When he had in this
                                    manner put together four or five hundred, he sent the whole to <pb
                                        xml:id="JG.356"/>
                                    <persName key="JoMurra1843">Murray</persName>, his publisher, in London. He
                                    often sat up all night, in the ardour of composition, and drank a sort of grog
                                    made of hollands and water&#8212;a beverage in which he indulged rather
                                    copiously when his Muse was coy. But, generally speaking, he was not addicted
                                    to the excessive drinking, though he has accused himself of that vice. To
                                    restrain the circumference of his person within proper limits, he frequently
                                    went without a dinner, or, at most, dined on a little bread and a solitary dish
                                    of vegetables. This frugal meal cost but a franc or two; and on such occasions
                                        <persName>Byron</persName> used, with much apparent complacency, to accuse
                                    himself of avarice. His extreme sensibility to the charms of music may partly
                                    be attributed to the chagrin occasioned by his domestic misfortunes. Music
                                    caused his tears to flow in abundance, and thus softened the asperity of his
                                    suffering. His feelings, however, on this subject, were those of a <foreign><hi
                                            rend="italic">d&#233;butante</hi></foreign>. When he had heard a new
                                    opera for upwards of a twelvemonth, he was often enraptured with a composition
                                    which had previously afforded him little pleasure, or which he had even
                                    severely criticized. I never observed <persName>Byron</persName> in a more
                                    delightful or unaffected vein of gaiety than on the day when we made an
                                    excursion about two miles from Milan, to visit the celebrated echo of
                                        <foreign>la <hi rend="italic">Simonetta</hi></foreign>, which repeats the
                                    report of a pistol-shot thirty or forty times. By way of contrast, the next
                                    day, at a grand dinner given by <persName key="LoBreme1820">Monsignor de
                                        Br&#234;me</persName>, his appearance was lowering as that of <persName

                                        >Nero</persName>. <persName>Byron</persName> arrived late, and was obliged
                                    to cross a spacious saloon, in which every eye was fixed on him and his club
                                    foot. Far from being the indifferent or phlegmatic personage, who alone can
                                    play the dandy to perfection, <persName>Byron</persName> was unceasingly
                                    tyrannized by some ruling passion. When not under the influence of nobler
                                    failings, he was tormented by an absurd vanity, which urged him to pretend to
                                    every thing. But his genius once awakened, his faults were <pb xml:id="JG.357"
                                    /> shaken off as a garment that would have incommoded the flight of his
                                    imagination: the poet soared beyond the confines of earth, and wafted his
                                    hearers along with him. Never shall I forget the sublime poem which he composed
                                    one evening on the subject of <persName key="CaCastr1328"
                                        >Castruccio-Castracani</persName>, the <persName key="Napoleon1"
                                        >Napoleon</persName> of the idle age. <persName>Byron</persName> had one
                                    failing in common with all poets&#8212;an extreme sensibility to praise or
                                    censure, especially when coming from a brother bard. He seemed not to be aware,
                                    that judgments of this nature are generally dictated by a spirit of
                                    affectation, and that the most favourable can only be termed certificates of
                                    resemblance. I must not omit to notice the astonishing effect produced on
                                        <persName>Lord Byron</persName> by the view of a fine painting of <persName
                                        key="DaCrespi1630">Daniel Crespi</persName>. The subject was taken from a
                                    well-known story of a monk supposed to have died in the odour of sanctity; and
                                    who, whilst his brethren were chanting the service of the dead around his bier
                                    in the church at midnight, was said to have suddenly lifted the funeral pall,
                                    and quitted his coffin, exclaiming, <q>&#8216;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Justo
                                                judicio Dei damnatus sum</hi></foreign>!&#8217;</q> We were unable
                                    to wrest <persName>Byron</persName> from the contemplation of this picture,
                                    which produced on his mind a sensation amounting to horror. To indulge his
                                    humour on this point, we mounted our horses in silence, and rode slowly towards
                                    a monastery at a little distance, where he shortly afterwards overtook us.
                                        <persName>Byron</persName> turned up his lips with an incredulous sneer
                                    when he heard, for the first time, that there are ten Italian dialects instead
                                    of one; and that amongst the whole population of Italy, only the inhabitants of
                                    Rome, Sienna, and Florence, speak the language as it is written. <persName
                                        key="SiPelli1854">Silvio Pellico</persName> once said to him: <q>&#8216;The
                                        most delightful of the ten or twelve Italian dialects, unknown beyond the
                                        Alps, is the Venetian. The Venetians are the French of Italy.&#8217;</q>
                                    <q>&#8216;They have, then, some comic poet
                                        living?&#8217;</q>&#8212;<q>&#8216;Yes, replied
                                            <persName>Pellico</persName>; &#8216;a charming poet; but as his
                                        comedies are not allowed to be performed, he composes them under the form
                                            <pb xml:id="JG.358"/> of satires. The name of this delightful poet is
                                            <persName key="PiBurat1832">Buratti</persName>; and every six months,
                                        by the governor&#8217;s orders, he pays a visit to one of the prisons of
                                        Venice.&#8217;</q> In my opinion, this conversation with <persName>Silvio
                                        Pellico</persName> gave the tone to <persName>Byron&#8217;s</persName>
                                    subsequent poetical career. He eagerly demanded the name of the bookseller who
                                    sold <persName>M. Buratti&#8217;s</persName> works; and as he was accustomed to
                                    the expression of Milanese bluntness, the question excited a hearty laugh at
                                    his expense. He was soon informed, that if <persName>Buratti</persName> wished
                                    to pass his whole life in prison, the appearance of his works in print would
                                    infallibly lead to the gratification of his desires; and besides, where could a
                                    printer be found hardy enough to run his share of the risk? an incomplete
                                    manuscript of <persName>Buratti</persName> cost from three to four sequins. The
                                    next day, the charming <persName>Comtessina N.</persName> was kind enough to
                                    lend her collection to one of our party. <persName>Byron</persName>, who
                                    imagined himself an adept in the language of <persName key="DaAligh"
                                        >Dante</persName> and <persName key="LuArios1533">Ariosto</persName>, was
                                    at first rather puzzled by <persName>Buratti&#8217;s</persName> manuscripts. We
                                    read over with him some of <persName>Goldoni&#8217;s</persName> comedies, which
                                    enabled him at last to comprehend <persName>Buratti&#8217;s</persName> satires.
                                    One of our Italian friends was even immoral enough to lend him a copy of
                                        <persName key="GiBaffo1768">Baffo&#8217;s</persName> sonnets. What a crime
                                    this had been in the eyes of <persName key="RoSouth1843">Southey</persName>!
                                    What a pity he was not, at an earlier period, made acquainted with the
                                    atrocious deed! I persist in thinking, that for the composition of <name
                                        type="title" key="LdByron.Beppo">Beppo</name>, and subsequently of <name
                                        type="title" key="LdByron.Juan">Don Juan</name>, <persName>Byron</persName>
                                    was indebted to the reading of <persName>Buratti&#8217;s</persName> poetry.
                                    Venice is a distinct world, of which the gloomy society of the rest of Europe
                                    can form no conception&#8212;care is there a subject of mockery. The poetry of
                                        <persName>Buratti</persName> always excites a sensation of enthusiastic
                                    delight in the breasts of the Venetian populace. Never, in my presence, did
                                    black and white, as the Venetians themselves say, produce a similar effect.
                                    Here, however, I ceased to act the part of an eyewitness, and here,
                                    consequently, I close my narrative.&#8221; </p>

                                    <salute> &#8220;Honoured Sir, </salute>
                                </opener>

                                <p xml:id="app.1.2-1"> &#8220;I am extremely sorry if I have not had it in my power
                                    to answer the kind letter with which you have honoured me, before this; being
                                    so very unwell, and so much hurt at the severe loss of much much-esteemed and
                                    ever-to-be-lamented lord and master. You wish me, Sir, to give you some
                                    information in respect to my Lord&#8217;s manner and mode of life after his
                                    departure from Cephalonia, which, I am happy to say, was that of a good
                                    Christian; and one who fears and serves God, in doing all the good that lay in
                                    his power, and avoiding all evil. And his charity was always without bounds;
                                    for his kind and generous heart could not see nor hear of misery, without a
                                    deep sigh, and striving in which way he could serve and soften misery, by his
                                    liberal hand, in the most effectual manner. Were I to mention one hundredth
                                    part of the most generous acts of charity, it would fill a volume. And, in
                                    regard to religion, I have every reason to think the world has been much to
                                    blame in judging too rashly on this most serious and important subject; for, in
                                    the course of my long services, more than twenty years, I have always, on
                                    account of the situation which I have held, been near to his Lordship&#8217;s
                                    person: and, by these means, have it in my power to speak to facts which I have
                                    many times witnessed, and conversations which I have had on the subject of
                                    religion. My Lord has more than once asked me my opinion on his
                                    Lordship&#8217;s life, whether I thought him as represented in some of the
                                    daily papers, as one devoid of religion, &amp;c. &amp;c.&#8212;words too base
                                    to mention. My Lord, moreover, said <q>&#8216;<persName key="WiFletc1831"
                                            >Fletcher</persName>, I know you are what, at least, they call a <pb
                                            xml:id="JG.360"/> Christian; do you think me exactly what they say of
                                        me&#8217;</q> I said, <q>&#8216;I do not, for I had too just reasons to
                                        believe otherwise.&#8217;</q> My Lord went on, on this subject, saying,
                                        <q>&#8216;I suppose, because I do not go to the church, I cannot any longer
                                        be a Christian;&#8217;</q>&#32;<q>but (he said) moreover, a man must be a
                                        great beast who cannot be a good Christian without being always in the
                                        church. I flatter myself I am not inferior in regard to my duty to many of
                                        them, for if I can do no good, I do no harm, which I am sorry to say of all
                                        churchmen.&#8217;</q> At another time, I remember it well, being a Friday,
                                    I at the moment not remembering it, said to my Lord, <q>&#8216;Will you have a
                                        fine plate of beccaficas?&#8217;</q> My Lord, half in anger, replied,
                                        <q>&#8216;Is not this Friday? how could you be so extremely lost to your
                                        duty to make such a request to me!&#8217;</q> At the same time saying,
                                        <q>&#8216;A man that can so much forget a duty as a Christian, who cannot,
                                        for one day in seven, forbid himself of these luxuries is no longer worthy
                                        to be called a Christian.&#8217;</q> And I can truly say, for the last
                                    eight years and upwards, his Lordship always left that day apart for a day of
                                    abstinence; and many more and more favourable proofs of a religious mind, than
                                    I have mentioned, which hereafter, if I find it requisite to the memory of my
                                    Lord, I shall undoubtedly explain to you. You, Sir, are aware, that my Lord was
                                    rather a man to be wondered at, in regard to some passages in the Holy
                                    Scriptures, which his Lordship did not only mention with confidence, but even
                                    told you in what chapter and what verse you would find such and such things,
                                    which I recollect filled you with wonder at the time and with satisfaction. </p>

                                <p xml:id="app.1.2-2"> &#8220;I remember, even so long back as when his Lordship
                                    was at Venice, several circumstances which must remove every doubt, even at the
                                    moment when my Lord was more gay than at any time after. In the year 1817, I
                                    have seen my Lord repeatedly, on meeting or passing any religious ceremonies
                                    which the Roman Catholics <pb xml:id="JG.361"/> have in their frequent
                                    processions, while at Nivia, near Venice, dismount his horse and fall on his
                                    knees, and remain in that posture till the procession had passed: and one of
                                    his Lordship&#8217;s grooms, who was backward in following the example of his
                                    Lordship, my Lord gave a violent reproof to. The man, in his defence, said,
                                        <q>&#8216;I am no Catholic, and by this means thought I ought not to follow
                                        any of their ways.&#8217;</q> My Lord answered very sharply upon the
                                    subject, saying, <q>&#8216;Nor am I a Catholic, but a Christian; which I should
                                        not be, were I to make the same objections which you make; for all
                                        religions are good, when properly attended to, without making it a mask to
                                        cover villany; which I am fully persuaded is too often the case.&#8217;</q>
                                    With respect to my Lord&#8217;s late publications which you mention, I am fully
                                    persuaded, when they come to be more fully examined, the passages which have
                                    been so much condemned, may prove something dark; but I am fully persuaded you
                                    are aware how much the public mind has been deceived in the true state of my
                                    lamented master. A greater friend to Christianity could not exist, I am fully
                                    convinced; in his daily conduct, not only making the Bible his first companion
                                    in the morning, but, in regard to whatever religion a man might be of, whether
                                    Protestant, Catholic, Friar, or Monk, or any other religion, every priest, of
                                    whatever order, if in distress, was always most liberally rewarded, and with
                                    larger sums than any one who was not a minister of the gospel, I think, would
                                    give. I think every thing combined together must prove, not only to you, Sir,
                                    but to the public at large, that my Lord was not only a Christian, but a good
                                    Christian. How many times has my Lord said to me, <q>&#8216;Never judge a man
                                        by his clothes, nor by his going to church, being a good Christian. I
                                        suppose you have heard that some people in England say that I am no
                                        Christian?&#8217;</q> I said, <q>&#8216;Yes, I have certainly heard of such
                                        things by some public prints, but I am fully convinced of their
                                        falsehood.&#8217;</q> My Lord <pb xml:id="JG.362"/> said, <q>&#8216;I know
                                        I do not go to church, like many of my accusers; but I have my hopes I am
                                        not less a Christian than they, for God examines the inward part of the
                                        man, not outward appearances.&#8217;</q> Sir, in answer to your inquiries,
                                    I too well know your character as a true Christian and a gentleman, to refuse
                                    giving you any further information respecting what you asked of me. In the
                                    first place, I have seen my Lord frequently read your books; and, moreover, I
                                    have more than once heard my Lord speak in the highest terms of, and receive
                                    you in the most friendly manner possible, whenever you could make it convenient
                                    to come to Metaxata; and with regard to the Bible, I think I only may refer to
                                    you, Sir, how much his Lordship must have studied it, by being able to refer to
                                    almost any passage in Scripture, and with what accuracy to mention even the
                                    chapter and verse in any part of the Scripture. Now, had my Lord not been a
                                    Christian, this book would most naturally have been thrown aside, and of course
                                    he would have been ignorant of so many fine passages which I have heard him
                                    repeat at intervals, when in the midst of his last and fatal illness. I mean
                                    after he began to be desirous. My Lord repeated <q>&#8216;I am not afraid to
                                        die;&#8217;</q> and in as composed a way as a child, without moving head or
                                    foot, or even a gasp, went as if he was going into the finest sleep, only
                                    opening his eyes and then shutting them again. I cried out <q>&#8216;I fear his
                                        Lordship is gone!&#8217;</q> when the doctors felt his pulse and said it
                                    was too true. I must say I am extremely miserable, to think my Lord might have
                                    been saved had the doctors done their duty, by letting blood in time, or by
                                    stating to me that my Lord would not allow it, and at the same time to tell me
                                    the truth of the real state of my Lord&#8217;s illness: but instead of that,
                                    they deceived me with the false idea that my Lord would be better in two or
                                    three days, and thereby prevented me from sending to Zante or Cephalonia, which
                                    I repeatedly wished to do, <pb xml:id="JG.363"/> but was prevented by them, I
                                    mean the doctors, deceiving me: but I dare say you have heard every particular
                                    about the whole; if not, I have no objection to give every particular during
                                    his illness. </p>

                                <p xml:id="app.1.2-3"> &#8220;I hope, Sir, your kind intentions may be crowned with
                                    success, in regard to the publication which you meant to bring before the
                                    British public. I must beg your pardon, when I make one remark, and which I am
                                    sure you know too well the tongues of the wicked, and in particular of the
                                    great, and how glad some would be to bring into ridicule any one that is of
                                    your religious and good sentiments of a future state, which every good
                                    Christian ought to think his first and greatest duty. For myself, I should be
                                    only too happy to be converted to the truth of the Gospel. But at this time, I
                                    fear it would be doing my Lord more harm than good, in publishing to the world
                                    that my Lord was converted, which to that extent of religion my Lord never
                                    arrived; but at the same time was a friend to both religion and religious
                                    people, of whatever religion they might be, and to none more, or more justly
                                    deserving, than <persName key="JaKenne1827">Dr. Kennedy</persName>. </p>

                    <p xml:id="app.2-2"> &#8220;This Abbey was founded in the year 1170, by <persName key="Henry2"
                            >Henry II.</persName>, as a Priory of Black Canons, and dedicated to the Virgin Mary.
                        It continued in the family of the <persName>Byrons</persName> until the time of our poet,
                        who sold it first to <persName key="ThClaugh1842">Mr. Claughton</persName>, for the sum of
                            140,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and on that gentleman&#8217;s not being able to
                        fulfil the agreement, and paying 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of a forfeit, it was
                        afterwards sold to another person, and most of the money vested in trustees, for the
                        jointure of <persName key="LyByron">Lady Byron</persName>. The greater part of the edifice
                        still remains. The present possessor, <persName key="ThWildm1859">Major Wildman</persName>,
                        is, with genuine taste, repairing this beautiful specimen of gothic architecture. The late
                            <persName key="LdByron">Lord Byron</persName> repaired a considerable part of it, but
                        forgetting the roof, he turned his attention to the inside, and the consequence was, that
                        in a few years, the rain penetrating to the apartments, soon destroyed all those elegant
                        devices which his Lordship contrived. <persName>Lord Byron&#8217;s</persName> own study was
                        a neat little apartment, decorated with some good classic busts, a select collection of
                        books, an antique cross, a sword in a gilt case, and at the end of the room two
                        finely-polished skulls, on a pair of light fancy stands. In the garden likewise, there was
                        a great number of these skulls, taken from the burial-ground of the Abbey, and piled up
                        together, but they were afterwards recommitted to the earth. A writer, who visited it soon
                        after <persName>Lord Byron</persName> had sold it, says, <q>&#8216;In one corner of the
                            servants&#8217; hall lay a stone coffin, <pb xml:id="JG.366"/> in which were
                            fencing-gloves and foils, and on the walls of the ample, but cheerless kitchen, was
                            painted, in large letters, &#8216;waste not&#8212;want not.&#8217; During the minority
                            of <persName>Lord Byron</persName>, the Abbey was in the possession of <persName
                                key="LdGrey19">Lord G&#8212;&#8212;</persName>, his hounds, and divers colonies of
                            jackdaws, swallows, and starlings. The internal traces of this Goth were swept away,
                            but without, all appeared as rude and unreclaimed as he could have left it. With the
                            exception of the dog&#8217;s tomb, a conspicuous and elegant object, I do not recollect
                            the slightest trace of culture or improvement. The <persName key="LdByron5">late
                                lord</persName>, a stern and desperate character, who is never mentioned by the
                            neighbouring peasants without a significant shake of the head, might have returned and
                            recognised every thing about him, except perhaps an additional crop of weeds. There
                            still slept that old pond, into which he is said to have hurled his lady in one of his
                            fits of fury, whence she was rescued by the gardener, a courageous blade, who was his
                            lord&#8217;s master, and chastised him for his barbarity. There still, at the end of
                            the garden, in a grove of oak, are two towering satyrs, he with his goat and club, and
                            Mrs. Satyr with her chubby cloven-footed brat, placed on pedestals, at the
                            intersections of the narrow and gloomy pathways, strike for a moment, with their grim
                            visages and silent shaggy forms, the fear into your bosom, which is felt by the
                            neighbouring peasantry, at &#8216;th&#8217; oud laird&#8217;s devils.&#8217; I have
                            frequently asked the country people what sort of a man his Lordship (our <persName>Lord
                                Byron</persName>) was. The impression of his eccentric but energetic character was
                            evident in the reply. &#8216;He&#8217;s the devil of a fellow for comical
                            fancies&#8212;he flag&#8217;s th&#8217; oud laird to nothing, but he&#8217;s a hearty
                            good fellow for all that.&#8217;</q>&#8221; </p>

                        connects with the house; the hall entire; the refectory entire; the cloister untouched,
                        with the ancient cistern of the convent, and their arms on it; it has a private chapel,
                        quite perfect. The park, which is still charming, has not been so much unprofaned. The
                            <persName key="LdByron5">present Lord</persName> has lost large sums, and paid part in
                        old oaks, five thousand pounds&#8217; worth of which have been cut near to the house. <hi

                    <p xml:id="app.2-6"> &#8220;It was on the noon of a cold bleak day in February, that I set out
                        to visit the memorable abbey of Newstead, once the property and abode of the immortal
                            <persName key="LdByron">Byron</persName>. The gloomy state of the weather, and the
                        dreary aspect of the surrounding country, produced impressions more appropriate to the
                        views of such a spot, than the cheerful season and scenery of summer. The estate lies on
                        the left hand side of the high north road, eight miles beyond Nottingham; but, as I
                        approached the place, I looked in vain for some indication of the abbey. Nothing is seen
                        but a thick plantation of young larch and firs, bordering the road, until you arrive at the
                        hut, a small public-house by the wayside. Nearly opposite to this is a plain white gate,
                        without lodges, opening into the park; before stands a fine spreading oak, one of the few
                        remaining trees of Sherwood forest, the famous haunt <pb xml:id="JG.368"/> of <persName
                            type="fiction">Robin Hood</persName> and his associates, which once covered all this
                        part of the country, and whose county was about the domain of Newstead. To this oak, the
                        only one of any size on the estate, <persName>Byron</persName> was very partial. It is
                        pretty well known that his great uncle (to whom he succeeded) cut down almost all the
                        valuable timber; so that, when Byron came into possession of the estate, and indeed, the
                        whole time he had it, it presented a very bare and desolate appearance. The soil is very
                        poor, and fit only for the growth of larch and firs; and, of these, upwards of 700 acres
                        have been planted. <persName>Byron</persName> could not afford the first outlay which was
                        necessary, in order ultimately to increase its worth; so that as long as he held it, the
                        rental did not exceed 1300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-year. From the gate to the abbey is a
                        mile. The carriage road runs straight for about three hundred yards through the
                        plantations, when it takes a sudden turn to the right; and, on returning to the left, a
                        beautiful and extensive view over the valley and distant hills is opened with the turrets
                        of the abbey, rising among the dark trees beneath. To the right of the abbey is perceived a
                        tower on a hill, in the midst of a grove of firs. From this part the road winds gently to
                        the left till it reaches the abbey, which is approached on the north side. It lies in a
                        valley very low; sheltered to the north and west, by rising ground; and to the south,
                        enjoying a fine prospect over an undulating vale. A more secluded spot could hardly have
                        been chosen for the pious purposes to which it was devoted. To the north and east is a
                        garden, walled in; and to the west the upper lake. On the west side, the mansion is without
                        any enclosure or garden-drive, and can therefore be approached by any person passing
                        through the park. In this open space is the ancient cistern, or fountain, of the convent,
                        covered with grotesque carvings, and having water still running into a basin. The old
                        church-window, which, in an architectural <pb xml:id="JG.369"/> point of view, is most
                        deserving of observation, is nearly entire, and adjoins the north-west corner of the abbey.
                        Through the iron gate which opens into the garden, under the arch, is seen the dog&#8217;s
                        tomb; it is on the north side, upon a raised ground, and surrounded by steps. The verses
                        inscribed on one side of the pedestal are well known, but the lines preceding them are not
                        so. They run thus: </p>

                    <p xml:id="app.2-7"> The whole edifice is a quadrangle, enclosing a court, with a reservoir,
                        and <foreign><hi rend="italic">jet d&#8217;eau</hi></foreign> in the middle; and the
                        cloisters still entire, running round the four sides. The south, now the principal front,
                        looks over a pleasure-garden to a small lake, which has been opened from the upper one,
                        since <persName key="LdByron">Byron&#8217;s</persName> time. The entrance-door is on the
                        west, in a small vestibule, and has nothing remarkable in it. On entering, I came into a
                        large stone hall, and turning to the left, went through it to a smaller one, beyond which
                        is the staircase. The whole of this part has been almost entirely rebuilt by <persName
                            key="ThWildm1859">Colonel Wildman</persName>; indeed, during
                            <persName>Byron&#8217;s</persName> occupation, the only habitable rooms were some small
                        ones in the south-east angle. Over the cloister, on the four sides of the building, runs
                        the gallery, from which doors open into various apartments, now fitted up with taste and
                        elegance, for the accommodation of a family, but then empty, and fast going to decay. In
                        one of the galleries hang two oil-paintings of dogs, as large as <pb xml:id="JG.370"/>
                        life; one, a red wolf-dog, and the other, a black Newfoundland, with white legs, the
                        celebrated <name type="animal">Boatswain</name>. They both died at Newstead. Of the latter,
                            <persName>Byron</persName> felt the loss as of a dear friend. These are almost the only
                        paintings of <persName>Byron&#8217;s</persName> which remain at the abbey. From the
                        gallery, I entered the refectory, now the grand drawing-room; an apartment of great
                        dimensions, facing south, with a fine vaulted roof, and polished oak floor, and splendidly
                        furnished in the modern style. The walls are covered with full-length portraits of the old
                        school. As this room has been made fit for use, entirely since the days of
                            <persName>Byron</persName>, there are not those associations connected with it which
                        are to be found in many of the others, though of inferior appearance. Two objects there
                        are, however, which demand observation. The first that caught my attention was the portrait
                        of <persName>Byron</persName>, by <persName key="ThPhill1845">Phillips</persName>, over the
                        fireplace, upon which I gazed with strong feelings; it is certainly the handsomest and most
                        pleasing likeness of him I have seen. The other is a thing about which every body has
                        heard, and of which few have any just idea. In a cabinet at the end of the room, carefully
                        preserved, and concealed in a sliding case, is kept the celebrated skull cup, upon which
                        are inscribed those splendid verses: <q>
                            <lg xml:id="JG.370a">
                                <l rend="indent20"> Start not, nor deem my spirit fled, &amp;c. </l>
                            </lg>
                        </q>
                    </p>

                    <p xml:id="app.2-8"> People often suppose, from the name, that the cup retains all the terrific
                        appearances of a death&#8217;s head, and imagine that they could <q>
                            <lg xml:id="JG.370b">
                                <l rend="indent20"> Behold through each lack-lustre eyeless hole </l>
                                <l rend="indent20"> The gay recess of wisdom and of wit. </l>
                            </lg>
                        </q> Not at all; there is nothing whatever startling in it. It is well polished, its edge
                        is bound by a broad rim of silver, and it is set in a neat stand of the same metal, which
                        serves as a handle, and upon the four sides of which, and not upon the skull itself, the
                            <pb xml:id="JG.371"/> verses are engraved. It is, in short, in appearance, a very
                        handsome utensil, and one from which the most fastidious person might (in my opinion) drink
                        without scruple. It was always produced after dinner, when <persName key="LdByron"
                            >Byron</persName> had company at the Abbey, and a bottle of claret poured into it. An
                        elegant round library-table is the only article of furniture in this room that belonged to
                            <persName>Byron</persName>, and this he constantly used. Beyond the refectory, on the
                        same floor, is Byron&#8217;s study, now used as a temporary dining-room, the entire
                        furniture of which is the same that was used by him. It is all very plain, indeed ordinary.
                        A good painting of a battle, over the sideboard, was also his. This apartment, perhaps,
                        beyond all others, deserves the attention of the pilgrim to Newstead, as more intimately
                        connected with the poetical existence of <persName>Byron</persName>. It was here that he
                        prepared for the press those first effusions of his genius which were published at Newark,
                        under the title of <name type="title" key="LdByron.Hours">Hours of Idleness</name>. It was
                        here that he meditated, planned, and for the most part wrote, that splendid retort to the
                        severe critiques they had called down, which stamped him as the keenest satirist of the
                        day. And it was here that his tender and beautiful <name type="title"
                            key="LdByron.MaryPicture">verses to Mary</name>, and many of those sweet pieces found
                        among his miscellaneous poems, were composed. His bed-room is small, and still remains in
                        the same state as when he occupied it; it contains little worthy of notice, besides the
                        bed, which is of common size, with gilt posts, surmounted by coronets. Over the fireplace
                        is a picture of <persName key="JosMurra">Murray</persName>, the old family servant who
                        accompanied <persName>Byron</persName> to Gibraltar, when he first went abroad. A picture
                        of <persName key="Henry8">Henry VIII.</persName>, and another portrait in this room,
                        complete the enumeration of all the furniture or paintings of
                            <persName>Byron&#8217;s</persName> remaining at the Abbey. In some of the rooms are
                        very curiously-carved mantel-pieces, with grotesque figures, evidently of old date. In a
                        corner of one of the galleries there still remained <pb xml:id="JG.372"/> the fencing
                        foils, gloves, masks, and single-sticks he used in his youth, and in a corner of the
                        cloister lies a stone coffin, taken from the burial ground of the abbey. The ground floor
                        contains some spacious halls and divers apartments for domestic offices, and there is a
                        neat little private chapel in the cloister, where service is performed on Sundays.
                            <persName>Byron&#8217;s</persName> sole recreation here was his boat and dogs, and
                        boxing and fencing for exercise, and to prevent a tendency to obesity, which he dreaded.
                        His constant employment was writing, for which he used to sit up as late as two or three
                        o&#8217;clock in the morning. His life here was an entire seclusion, devoted to poetry. </p>
