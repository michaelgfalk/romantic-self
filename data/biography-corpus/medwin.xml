                    <hi rend="small-caps">Twenty-four</hi> years have elapsed since <persName key="PeShell1822"
                        >Shelley</persName> was withdrawn from the world, and no &#8220;record&#8221; of him
                    &#8220;remains,&#8221; save a few fugitive notices scattered about in periodicals. The Notes,
                    it is true, appended to the last edition of his works, are highly valuable, and full of
                    eloquence and feeling, but they relate rather to the &#8220;<q>origin and history</q>&#8221; of
                    those works, than of the poet, and date only from 1814; leaving his life up to that period a
                    blank, that imperatively requires to be filled up. </p>

                <p xml:id="Pre-2">
                    <persName key="MaShell1851">Mrs. Shelley</persName>, in January, 1839, <name type="title"
                        key="PeShell1822.PoeticalWorks">says</name>, &#8220;<q>this <hi rend="italic">is not the
                            time to tell the truth</hi>, and I should <pb xml:id="I.iv"/> reject any colouring of
                        the truth,</q>&#8221; and adds, that &#8220;<q>the errors of action committed by a man as
                        noble and generous as <persName key="PeShell1822">Shelley</persName>, may, as far only as
                        he is concerned, be fearlessly avowed by those who loved him, in the firm conviction, that
                        were they <hi rend="italic">judged impartially</hi>, his character would stand fairer and
                        brighter than that of any of his contemporaries.</q>&#8221; </p>

                <p xml:id="Pre-3"> The long interval which has transpired since the writing of this passage, makes
                    me conclude that the amiable and gifted person who penned it, has abandoned, if she had ever
                    formed, the intention of executing this &#8220;<q>labour of love;</q>&#8221; and the more so,
                    as in 1824, she points out <persName key="LeHunt">Leigh Hunt</persName> as &#8220;<q>the person
                        best calculated for such an undertaking.</q>&#8221; </p>

                <p xml:id="Pre-4"> &#8220;<q>The distinguished friendship that <persName key="PeShell1822"
                            >Shelley</persName> felt for him, and the enthusiastic affection with which he clings
                        to the memory of his friend,</q>&#8221; no doubt well qualified him, on those two grounds,
                    for Shelley&#8217;s biographer; but he doubtless felt that an acquaintance of nine or ten
                    years, most <pb xml:id="I.v"/> of which were passed by <persName>Shelley</persName> abroad,
                    furnished him with very inadequate materials. </p>

                <p xml:id="Pre-5"> Sensible how much more fitted he would have been to have performed this office
                    than myself, I should have been happy to have supplied him with data absolutely requisite for
                    tracing <persName key="PeShell1822">Shelley&#8217;s</persName> genius from its first germs up
                    to its maturity, and forming an impartial judgment of his character&#8212;data which no one but
                    myself could have supplied, inasmuch as I knew him from childhood&#8212;as, we were at school
                    together, continually together during the vacations, corresponded regularly, and although I
                    lost sight of him for a few years when in the East, because our intimacy was renewed on my
                    return; and, more than all, because I passed the two last winters and springs of his existence,
                    one under his roof, and the other with him, without the interruption of a single day. </p>

                <p xml:id="Pre-6"> It may be objected that these memorabilia are imperfect, from the almost total
                    want of letters. Unhappily all those&#8212;and they would have formed <pb xml:id="I.vi"/>
                    volumes&#8212;which I received from him in early youth, were lost, from my not having the
                    habit, at that time, of preserving letters, and that those which passed between us from 1819 to
                    1822, were lent, and never returned. </p>

                <p xml:id="Pre-7">
                    <persName key="MaShell1851">Mrs. Shelley</persName> has, in one of the volumes containing her

                    the world the letters she could collect; but, precious as they are in a literary point of view,
                    particularly those to <persName key="ThPeaco1866">Mr. Peacock</persName>, they throw but little
                    light on his life or pursuits. Those letters also are few in number. After the appearance of
                    the <name type="title" key="JoColer1876.Revolt">Quarterly Review article</name>, in 1818, many
                    of his friends appear to have fallen off&#8212;at least discontinued writing to him, and he
                    limits them to &#8220;<q>three or four, or even less.</q>&#8221; </p>

                <p xml:id="Pre-8"> But are letters the best <hi rend="italic">media</hi> for developing character?
                    Judging from <persName key="LdByron">Byron&#8217;s</persName>, I should certainly answer in the
                    negative. In his epistolary correspondence, a man always adapts his style and sentiments to the
                    capacity and ways of thinking of those with whom the interchange is <pb xml:id="I.vii"/>
                    carried on; besides, that a person must be intimate indeed with another to lay bare his heart
                    to him; to disclose unreservedly what can only be unfolded in the confidentiality of social
                    intercourse. </p>

                <p xml:id="Pre-9"> It was my determination, on commencing this work, to have differed from all
                    writers of Memoirs, in stating what <persName key="PeShell1822">Shelley&#8217;s</persName>
                    actions and opinions were, and letting the world judge them; but I soon found that such ground
                    was untenable, and was dissatisfied with making myself a mere chronicler; besides that with a
                    knowledge of the motives of his actions, it would have been a gross injustice to have
                    suppressed them. I was strengthened in this resolution by the advice of the author of
                        &#8220;<name type="title" key="ThHogg1862.Shelley">Shelley at Oxford</name>,&#8221; to whom
                    I am much indebted in these pages, who says, &#8220;<q>The biographer who would take upon
                        himself the pleasing and instructing, but difficult and delicate task of composing a
                        faithful history of his whole life, will frequently be compelled to discuss the important
                        questions, whether his conduct at cer-<pb xml:id="I.viii"/>tain periods was altogether such
                        as ought to be proposed for imitation; whether he was ever misled by a glowing temperament,
                        something of hastiness in choice, and a certain constitutional impatience; whether, like
                        less gifted mortals, he ever shared in the common feature of mortality,
                        repentance,&#8212;and to what extent.</q>&#8221; </p>

                <p xml:id="Pre-10"> These questions I have fully discussed. How painfully interesting is his Life!

                    might not have paled before it. Such as it is, I throw it on the indulgence of his friends and
                    the public. It has been written with no indecorous haste&#8212;by one sensible of the
                    difficulty of the task&#8212;of his inadequacy to do it justice&#8212;of his unworthiness to

                            <persName>Edward</persName>; from the latter of whom, in the seventh descent, sprung

                        an American lady&#8212;at Christ&#8217;s Church, Newark, in North America; where <persName
                            key="ByShell1815">Bysshe</persName> was born, on the 21st June, 1731. </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch1-3"> As often happens to the junior branches of houses, he began life with few of
                        the goods of fortune, and little chance of worldly aggrandisement. America was then the
                        land of promise; but it was <hi rend="italic">only</hi> such to him. He there exercised the
                        profession of a Quack doctor, and married, as it is said, the widow of a miller, but for
                        this I cannot vouch. </p>

                        should have captivated the great heiress of Horsham, the only daughter and heiress of the
                            <persName>Rev. Theobald Michell</persName>. The guardian (the young lady was an orphan

                        that convenient asylum for lovers, the Fleet, by the Fleet parson, and lost no time in
                        repairing to Paris. There the lady was attacked, on her arrival, with the small-pox, and

                        but as the largest fortune in Kent. He succeeded so well in ingratiating himself with this

                        somewhat singular that that title should, in the face of it, have been conferred by the

                        was the coldblooded, and times-serving, and foul-mouthed, <persName key="EdCoke1634">Lawyer

                        proud of anything, it was of his connection with the <persName>Sidneys</persName>, and that

                            xml:id="I.7"/> he offered <persName>Percy Bysshe</persName> £3000 to renounce his
                        contingency, but which, distressed as he was for money, he refused. </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch1-9"> On the 3rd March, 1806, <persName key="ByShell1815">Bysshe</persName>, the
                        grandfather, was raised to the baronetage. He owed this distinction, if such it be, to
                            <persName key="DuNorfo11">Charles, Duke of Norfolk</persName>, who wished thereby to
                        win over to his party the <persName>Shelley</persName> interest in the western part of the
                        county of Sussex and the Rape of Bramber, not to mention Horsham, on which he had at this
                        period electioneering designs. </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch1-10"> I remember <persName key="ByShell1815">Sir Bysshe</persName> well in a very
                        advanced age, a remarkably handsome man, fully six feet in height, and with a noble and
                        aristocratic bearing. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Nil fuit unquam sic impar
                            sibi</hi></foreign>. His manner of life was most eccentric, for he used to frequent
                        daily the tap-room of one of the low inns in Horsham, and there drank with some of the
                        lowest citizens, a habit he had probably acquired in the new world. Though he had built a
                        castle, (Goring Castle) that cost him upwards of £80,000, he passed the last twenty <pb
                            xml:id="I.8"/> or thirty years of his existence in a small cottage, looking on the
                        river Arun, at Horsham, in which all was mean and beggarly&#8212;the existence, indeed, of
                        a miser-&#8212;enriching his legatees at the expense of one of his sons, by buying up his
                        post-obits. </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch1-11"> In order to dispose of him, I will add that his affectionate son <persName

                        till he became one of the oldest heir-apparents in England, and began to think his father
                        immortal. God takes those to him, who are worth taking, early, and drains to the last sands
                        in the glass, the hours of the worthless and immoral, in order that they may reform their
                        ways. But his were unredeemed by one good action. Two of his daughters by the second
                        marriage led so miserable a life under his roof, that they eloped from him; a consummation
                        he devoutly wished, as he thereby found an excuse for giving them no dowries; and though
                        they were married to two highly respectable men, and one had a numerous <pb xml:id="I.9"/>
                        family, he made no mention of either of them in his will. </p>

                            Tour</hi>. He was one of those travellers, who, with so much waste of time, travel for

                        home, knowing no more of the countries they have visited than the trunks attached to their
                        carriages. All, indeed, that he did bring back with him was a smattering of French, and a

                        Field Place, and received the same education as his elder sisters, being instructed in the
                        rudiments of Latin and Greek by <persName>Mr. Edwards</persName>, the clergyman of Warnham,
                        (the parish in which they lived), a good old man, but of very limited intellects, and whose
                        preaching might have been edifying if his Welch pronunciation had made it intelligible; at
                        all events, his performance of the service was little calculated to inspire devotion. At
                        ten years of age he was sent to Sion House, Brentford, where I had preceded him. This
                        school, though not a &#8220;Dotheboys-hall,&#8221; was conducted with the greatest regard

                        twice without its eliciting an observation from the distributor, that effectually prevented
                        a repetition of the offence, was made up generally of ingredients that were anonymous. The

                        to a boy accustomed to the delicacies of the table, was not the most attractive; the whole

                        the rule of a few petty sovereigns; and although here the elder boys did not oblige their
                        juniors to perform for them offices the most menial, to clean their coats and shoes, they
                        forced them to bowl to them at cricket, and run after their balls until they were ready to
                        drop with fatigue&#8212;to go out of bounds for them to the circulating library, or

                        pounce upon a <hi rend="italic">fresh man</hi> with the boldness of birds of prey. We all
                        had had to pass through this ordeal, and the remembrance of it gave my companions a zest
                        for torture. All tormented him with questionings. There was no end to their mockery, when
                        they found that he was ignorant of pegtop or <pb xml:id="I.18"/> marbles, or leap-frog, or
                        hopscotch, much more of fives and cricket. One wanted him to spar, another to run a race
                        with him. He was a tyro in both these accomplishments, and the only welcome of the Neophyte
                        was a general shout of derision. To all these impertinences he made no reply, but with a
                        look of disdain written in his countenance, turned his back on his new associates, and when
                        he was alone, found relief in tears. </p>

                        <persName key="PeShell1822">Shelley</persName> was at this time tall for his age, slightly
                        and delicately built, and rather narrow chested, with a complexion fair and ruddy, a face
                        rather long than oval. His features, not regularly handsome, were set off by a profusion of
                        silky brown hair, that curled naturally. The expression of countenance was one of exceeding
                        sweetness and innocence. His blue eyes were very large and prominent, considered by
                        phrenologists to indicate a great aptitude for verbal memory. They were at times, when he
                        was abstracted, as he often was in contemplation, dull, and, as it were, <pb xml:id="I.19"
                        /> insensible to external objects; at others they flashed with the fire of intelligence.
                        His voice was soft and low, but broken in its tones,&#8212;when anything much interested
                        him, harsh and immodulated; and this peculiarity he never lost. As is recorded of <persName
                            key="JaThoms1748">Thomson</persName>, he was naturally calm, but when he heard of or
                        read of some flagrant act of injustice, oppression, or cruelty, then indeed the sharpest
                        marks of horror and indignation were visible in his countenance. </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch2-10"> I have said that he was delicately framed, and it has been <name

                            intellect is kept ever alive, and the spirits continually are agitated.</q>&#8221; </p>

                            could not be more susceptible of all <pb xml:id="I.20"/> the sweet charities than his.
                            In this respect <persName key="PeShell1822">Shelley&#8217;s</persName> disposition
                            would happily illustrate the innocence and virginity of the Muses. He possessed a most
                            affectionate regard for his relations, and particularly for the females of his family.
                            It was not without manifest joy that he received a letter from his mother and
                            sisters,</q>&#8221;&#8212;for the two eldest he had an especial fondness, and I will
                        here observe that one, unhappily removed from the world before her time, possessed a talent
                        for oil-painting that few artists have acquired, and that the other bore a striking
                        resemblance in her beauty and amiability, to his cousin, <persName key="HaHelya1867"
                            >Harriet Grove</persName>, of whom I shall have to speak. <persName key="ThHogg1862"
                            >Mr. Hogg</persName> mentions, on the occasion of <persName>Shelley&#8217;s</persName>
                        seeing the attachment and tenderness of two sisters at Oxford, his feelings regarding the
                        sisterly affections, and says he seems to have had his own in his eye. He on this occasion
                        described their appearance, and drew a lovely picture of this amiable and innocent
                        attachment; the dutiful regard of the younger, <pb xml:id="I.21"/> which partook, in some
                        degree, of filial reverence; but, as more fasile and familiar, and of the protecting,
                        instinctively hoping fondness of the elder, that resembled maternal tenderness, but with
                        less of reserve and more of sympathy. </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch2-12"> As a proof of his great sweetness of disposition and feeling for others, I
                        will cite an example of which I was an eye-witness. His sisters, on the occasion of a visit
                        with himself to a young lady of their own age, and a near relation, who was shy, reserved,
                        and awkward, behaved to her as he considered rudely, at which <persName key="PeShell1822"
                            >Shelley</persName> was much hurt, endeavoured to soothe her, and severely reprimanded
                        his sisters, and persuaded his father, on his return home, to call and make apology for
                        them. </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch2-13"> Such was <persName key="PeShell1822">Shelley</persName> when noviciated at
                        Sion House Academy. Our master, a Scotch doctor of law, and a divine, was a choleric man,
                        of a sanguinary complexion, in a green old age; not wanting in good qualities, but very
                        capricious in his temper, which, good or bad, was influenced <pb xml:id="I.22"/> by the
                        daily occurrences of a domestic life, not the most harmonious, and of which his face was
                        the barometer, and his hand the index. He was a tolerable Greek and Latin scholar:

                            <persName key="Eurip406">Euripides</persName>, looking upon the text as immaculate,
                        never sticking fast at any of its corruptions, but driving straight forwards, in defiance

                        he troubled himself as little with digressions or explanations of the habits and customs of
                        the ancients, or maps. His Latin verses were certainly original, but neither Virgilian nor
                        Ovidian, for I remember an inscription of his on a Scotch mull, which had been presented to
                        him (he took an inordinate quantity of Scotch snuff) by one of his pupils, it ran

                        study, for during school-hours he was wont to gaze at the passing clouds,&#8212;all that
                        could be seen from the lofty windows which his desk fronted&#8212;or watch the swallows as

                        applicable to the <pb xml:id="I.25"/> purpose. The hexameter I forget, but the pentameter
                        ran thus:&#8212; <q>

                        a peculiar expression in his features, which, like the lightning before the storm,
                        portended what was coming. The spectacles, generally lifted above his dark and bushy brows,
                        were lowered to their proper position, and their lenses had no sooner caught the said
                        hexameter and pentameter than he read with a loud voice the stolen line, laying a sarcastic
                        emphasis on every word, and suiting the action to the word by boxes on each side of
                            <persName>Shelley&#8217;s</persName> ears. Then came the comment,

                        ridicule of the whole school; and I was half inclined to have opened my desk, and produced,
                        to the shame of the ignorant pedagogue, the original line of the great Latin poet, which
                        this <persName type="fiction">Crispinus</persName> had so savagely abused, but terror, a
                        persuasion that his penance would be light compared to mine, soon repressed the impulse. </p>

                    <pb xml:id="I.27"/>

                    <p xml:id="ch2-19"> Youthful feelings are not deep, but the impression of this scene long left
                        a sting behind it; perhaps <persName key="PeShell1822">Shelley</persName>, in brooding over
                        the prediction as to his incapacity for writing Latin verses, then resolved to falsify it,
                        for he afterwards, as will appear by two specimens which I give in their proper place,
                        became a great proficient in the art. </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch2-20"> He passed among his schoolfellows as a strange and unsocial being, for when
                        a holiday relieved us from our tasks, and the other boys were engaged in such sports as the
                        narrow limits of our prison-court allowed, <persName key="PeShell1822">Shelley</persName>,
                        who entered into none of them, would pace backwards and forwards&#8212;I think I see him
                        now&#8212;along the southern wall, indulging in various vague and undefined ideas, the
                        chaotic elements, if I may say so, of what afterwards produced so beautiful a world. I very
                        early learned to penetrate into this soul sublime&#8212;why may I not say divine, for what
                        is there that comes nearer to God than genius in the heart of a child? I, too, was the only
                        one at the school with whom he could communicate <pb xml:id="I.28"/> his sufferings, or
                        exchange ideas: I was, indeed, some years his senior, and he was grateful to me for so
                        often singling him out for a companion; for it is well known that it is considered in some
                        degree a <hi rend="italic">condescension</hi> for boys to make intimates of those in a
                        lower form than themselves. Then we used to walk together up and down his favourite spot,
                        and there he would outpour his sorrows to me, with observations far beyond his years, and
                        which, according to his after ideas, seemed to have sprung from an antenatal life. I have
                        often thought that he had these walks of ours in mind, when, in describing an antique
                        group, he says, &#8220;<q>Look, the figures are walking with a sauntering and idle pace,
                            and talking to each other as they walk, as you may have seen a younger and an elder boy
                            at school, walking in some grassy spot of the play-ground, with that tender friendship
                            for each other which the age inspires.</q>&#8221; If <persName>Shelley</persName>
                        abominated one task more than another it was a dancing lesson. At a Ball at
                            <persName>Willis&#8217;s</persName> rooms, where, among other pupils of
                            <persName>Sala</persName>, I made one, an aunt of mine, to whom the <pb xml:id="I.29"/>
                        Letter No. 1, in the Appendix, was addressed, asked the dancing master why
                            <persName>Bysshe</persName> was not present, to which he replied in his broken English,
                            &#8220;<q>Mon Dieu, madam, what should he do here? <persName>Master Shelley</persName>
                            will not learn any ting&#8212;he is so <foreign><hi rend="italic"
                            >gauche</hi></foreign>.</q>&#8221; In fact, he contrived to abscond as often as
                        possible from the dancing lessons, and when forced to attend, suffered inexpressibly. </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch2-21"> Half-year after half-year passed away, and in spite of his seeming neglect
                        of his tasks, he soon surpassed all his competitors, for his memory was so tenacious that
                        he never forgot a word once turned up in his dictionary. He was very fond of reading, and
                        greedily devoured all the books which were brought to school after the holidays; these were
                        mostly <hi rend="italic">blue</hi> books. Who does not know what blue books mean? but if
                        there should be any one ignorant enough not to know what those dear darling volumes, so
                        designated from their covers, contain, be it known, that they are or were to be bought for
                        sixpence, and embodied stories of haunted castles, bandits, murderers, and other grim
                        personages&#8212;a most exciting and <pb xml:id="I.30"/> interesting sort of food for
                        boys&#8217; minds; among those of a larger calibre was one which I have never seen since,
                        but which I still remember with a <foreign><hi rend="italic">recouchè</hi></foreign>
                        delight. It was &#8220;<name type="title" key="RoPalto1767.Wilkins">Peter

                    <p xml:id="ch2-22"> But this stock was very soon exhausted. As there was no school library, we
                        soon resorted, &#8220;under the rose,&#8221; to a low circulating one in the town
                        (Brentford), and here the treasures at first seemed inexhaustible. Novels at this time, (I
                        speak of 1803) in three goodly volumes, such as we owe to the great <persName key="WaScott"
                            >Wizard of the North</persName>, were unknown. <persName key="SaRicha1761"
                            >Richardson</persName>, <persName key="HeField1754">Fielding</persName>, and <persName

                        authors were little to <persName key="PeShell1822">Shelley&#8217;s</persName> taste.
                            <persName key="AnRadcl1823">Anne Ratcliffe&#8217;s</persName> works pleased him most,

                            <persName key="ChDacre1825">Rosa-Matilda</persName> school, especially a strange, wild
                        romance, entitled &#8220;<name type="title" key="ChDacre1825.Zofloya">Zofloya, or the

                        where his Satanic Majesty, as in <name type="title" key="JoGoeth1832.Faust">Faust</name>,
                        plays the chief part, enraptured him. The two novels he afterwards <pb xml:id="I.31"/>
                        wrote, entitled &#8220;<name type="title" key="PeShell1822.Zastrozzi"

                        now remember, is, that the principal character is an incarnatian of the devil, but who,

                        reading. It is said of <persName key="WiColli1759">Collins</persName> that he employed his
                        mind chiefly upon works of fiction <pb xml:id="I.32"/> and subjects of fancy, and by
                        indulging some peculiar habits of thought was universally delighted with those nights of
                        imagination which pass the bounds of nature, and to which the mind is reconciled only by a
                        passive acquiescence in popular tradition. He loved fairies, genii, giants, and monsters;
                        he delighted to rove through the meanders of enchantment, to gaze on the magnificence of
                        golden palaces, to repose by the waterfalls of Elysian gardens. <persName key="JoMilto1674"
                            >Milton</persName>, too, in early life, lived in a similar dream-land, was fond of high
                        romance and gothic diableries; and it would seem that such contemplations furnish a fit
                                <foreign><hi rend="italic">pabulum</hi></foreign> for the development of poetical

                    <p xml:id="ch2-25"> After supping on the horrors of the Minerva press, he was subject to
                        strange, and sometimes frightful dreams, and was haunted by apparitions that bore all the
                        semblance of reality. We did not sleep in the same dormitory, but I shall never forget one
                        moonlight night seeing <persName key="PeShell1822">Shelley</persName> walk into my room. He
                        was in a state of somnambulism. His eyes were open, and he advanced with slow steps to the
                        window, which, it being the height of summer, was open, I got <pb xml:id="I.34"/> out of
                        bed, seized him with my arm, and waked him&#8212;I was not then aware of the danger of
                        suddenly rousing the sleep-walker. He was excessively agitated, and after leading him back
                        with some difficulty to his couch, I sat by him for some time, a witness to the severe
                        erethism of his nerves, which the sudden shock produced. </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch2-26"> This was the only occasion, however, to my knowledge, that a similar event
                        occurred at school, but I remember that he was severely punished for this involuntary
                        transgression. If, however, he ceased at that time to somnambulize, he was given to waking
                        dreams, a sort of lethargy and abstraction that became habitual to him, and after the
                                <foreign><hi rend="italic">accès</hi></foreign> was over, his eyes flashed, his
                        lips quivered, his voice was tremulous with emotion, a sort of ecstacy came over him, and
                        he talked more like a spirit or an angel than a human being. </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch2-27"> The second or third year after <persName key="PeShell1822"
                            >Shelley&#8217;s</persName> domicile at Sion House, <persName key="AdWalke1821"
                            >Walker</persName> gave a course of lectures in the great room at the academy, and <pb
                            xml:id="I.35"/> displayed his Orrery. This exhibition opened to
                            <persName>Shelley</persName> a new universe of speculations; he was, till then, quite
                        ignorant of astronomy; looking upon the stars as so many lights in heaven, as flowers on
                        the earth, sent for our mere gratification and enjoyment; but if he was astonished at the
                        calculations of the mathematician, and the unfolding of our System, he was still more
                        delighted at the idea of a plurality of worlds. Saturn, which was then visible, and which
                        we afterwards looked at through a telescope, particularly interested him, its atmosphere
                        seeming to him an irrefragable proof of its being inhabited like our globe. He dilated on
                        some planets being more favoured than ourselves, and was enchanted with the idea that we
                        should, as spirits, make the grand tour through the heavens,&#8212;perhaps, to use the
                        words of <persName key="JoRicht1825">Jean Paul Richter</persName>, &#8220;<q>that as boys
                            are advanced and promoted from one class to another, we should rise to a progressive
                            state from planet to planet, till we became Gods.</q>&#8221; But if his mind was thus
                        opened, he was not less <pb xml:id="I.36"/> charmed at the chemical experiments,
                        particularly with the fact that earth, air, and water are not simple elements. This course
                        of lectures ended with the solar microscope, which, whilst it excited his curiosity,
                        constituted to most of us little spectators the most attractive part of the exhibition. The
                        mites in cheese, where the whole active population was in motion&#8212;the wing of a
                        fly&#8212;the vermicular animalcules in vinegar, and other minute creations still smaller,
                        and even invisible to the naked eye, formed afterwards the subjects of many of our
                        conversations; and that he had not forgotten the subject is proved by his making a solar
                        microscope his constant companion, and an anecdote is told in reference to it, which places
                        in a strong light his active benevolence:&#8212;&#8220;<q>We were crossing the New
                            Road,</q>&#8221; says <persName key="ThHogg1862">Mr. Hogg</persName>, &#8220;<q>when he
                            said sharply, &#8216;<q>I must call for a moment, but it will not be out of the way at
                                all,</q>&#8217; and then dragged me suddenly towards the left. I enquired whither
                            are we bound, and I believe I suggested the postpone-<pb xml:id="I.37"/>ment of the
                            intended visit till to-morrow. He answered that it was not at all out of our way. I was
                            hurried along rapidly towards the left; we soon fell into an animated discussion
                            respecting the nature of the virtue of the Romans, which in some measure beguiled the
                            weary way. Whilst he was talking with much vehemence, and a total disregard of the
                            people who thronged the streets, he suddenly wheeled about, and pushed me through a
                            narrow door; to my infinite surprise I found myself in a pawnbroker&#8217;s shop. It
                            was in the neighbourhood of Newgate street, for he had no idea whatever, in practice,
                            either of time or space, nor did he in any degree regard method in the conduct of
                            business. There were several women in the shop in brown and grey cloaks, with squalling
                            children, some of them were attempting to persuade the children to be quiet, or, at
                            least, to scream with moderation; others were enlarging and pointing out the beauties
                            of certain coarse and dirty sheets that lay before them, to a man on the other side of
                            the <pb xml:id="I.38"/> counter. I bore this substitute for our proposed tea for some
                            minutes with great patience, but, as the call did not promise to terminate speedily, I
                            said to Shelley in a whisper, &#8216;<q>Is not this almost as bad as the Roman
                                virtue?</q>&#8217; Upon this he approached the pawnbroker: it was long before he
                            obtained a hearing, and he did not find civility; the man was unwilling to part with a
                            valuable pledge so soon, or perhaps he hoped to retain it eventually, or it might be
                            the obliquity of his nature disqualified him for respectful behaviour. A pawnbroker is
                            frequently an important witness in criminal proceedings; it has happened to me,
                            therefore, to see many specimens of this kind of banker; they sometimes appeared not
                            less respectable than other tradesmen&#8212;and sometimes I have been forcibly reminded
                            of the first I ever met with by an equally ill-conditioned fellow. I was so little
                            pleased with the introduction, that I stood aloof in the shop, and did not hear what
                            passed between him and <persName>Shelley</persName>. On our way to Covent Garden, I
                            expressed my surprise and <pb xml:id="I.39"/> dissatisfaction at our strange visit, and
                            I learned that when he came to London before, in the course of the summer, some old man
                            had related to him a tale of distress&#8212;of a calamity which could only be
                            alleviated by the timely application of ten pounds; five of them he drew from his
                            pocket, and to raise the other five he had pawned his beautiful solar microscope! He
                            related this act of beneficence simply and briefly as if it were a matter of course,
                            and such indeed it was to him. I was ashamed of my impatience, and we strode along in
                            silence.</q>
                    </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch2-28"> &#8220;<q>It was past ten when we reached the hotel, some excellent tea and
                            a liberal supply of hot muffins in the coffee-room, now quiet and solitary, were the
                            more grateful after the wearisome delay and vast deviation. <persName key="PeShell1822"
                                >Shelley</persName> often turned his head, and cast eager glances towards the door;
                            and whenever the waiter replenished our teapot, or approached our box, he was
                            interrogated whether any one had called. At last the desired summons was brought;
                                <persName>Shelley</persName> drew forth some <pb xml:id="I.40"/> bank notes,
                            hurried to the bar, and returned as hastily, bearing in triumph under his arm a
                            mahogany box, followed by the officious waiter, with whose assistance he placed it upon
                            the bench by his side. He viewed it often with evident satisfaction, and sometimes
                            patted it affectionately in the course of calm conversation. The solar microscope was
                            always a favourite plaything, or instrument of scientific inquiry; whenever he entered
                            a house his first care was to choose some window of a southern aspect, and if
                            permission could be obtained by prayer or purchase, straightway cut a hole through the
                            shutter to receive it. His regard for the solar microscope was as lasting as it was
                            strong; for he retained it several years after this adventure, and long after he had
                            parted with all the rest of his philosophical apparatus.</q>&#8221; </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch3-1"> But to return to Zion House, and perhaps I have dwelt long enough on the
                        first epoch of the life of the Poet. I was removed to a public school, with only one
                        regret&#8212;to part from him; and <persName key="PeShell1822">Shelley</persName> shortly
                        afterwards <pb xml:id="I.41"/> was sent to Eton. So much did we mutually hate Sion House,
                        that we never alluded to it in after life; nor shall I have much to say about Eton. The <hi
                            rend="italic">pure</hi> system of fagging was here, as it still is, carried on in all
                        its rankness; and, as it is the maxim of jurisprudence, that custom makes law&#8212;that
                        tradition stands in the place of, and has the force of law&#8212;has continued to defy all
                        attempts to put it down. By the way, in one of the military colleges, hardly a year ago, a
                        young man was rolled up in a snow-ball, and left in his room during the time the other
                        cadets were at church. The consequence was, that though restored to animation, he still is,
                        and is likely to remain all his life, a cripple. The authorities, to whom an appeal was
                        made against this barbarous treatment, refused to interfere. <persName>Shelley</persName>,
                            <persName key="MaShell1851">Mrs. Shelley</persName> says, &#8220;<q>refusing to fag at
                            Eton, was treated with revolting cruelty by masters and boys. This roused, instead of
                            taming his spirit, and he rejected the duty of obedience, when it was enforced by
                            menaces and punishment.</q>&#8221; </p>

                    <pb xml:id="I.42"/>

                    <p xml:id="ch3-2"> &#8220;<q>To aversion to the society of his fellow-creatures, such as he
                            found them, collected together in societies, where one egged on the other to acts of
                            tyranny, was joined the deepest sympathy and compassion; while the attachment he felt
                            to individuals, and the admiration with which he regarded their prowess and virtue, led
                            him to entertain a high opinion of the perfectibility of human nature; and he believed
                            that all could reach the highest grade of moral improvement, did not the customs and
                            prejudices of society foster evil passions and excuse evil actions.</q>&#8221; </p>

                            he held it before the fire to dry, I offered to take it from him; he said it was not
                            worth looking at, but I persisted, through a certain scholastic curiosity, to examine
                            the Latinity of my new acquaintance. He gave it me. The Latin was sufficiently correct,
                            but the version was paraphrastic; which I observed; he assented, and said it would pass
                            muster, and he felt no interest in such efforts, and no desire to excel in them. I also
                            noticed many portions of heroic verse, and several entire verses, and these I pointed
                            out as defects in a prose composition. He smiled archly, and added in his peculiar
                            whisper: &#8216;<q>Do you think they will observe them?</q>&#8217; I inserted <pb

                            many verses, but he observed them, scanned them, and asked why I had introduced
                            them&#8212;I answered that I did not know they were there&#8212;this was partly true
                            and partly false, and he believed me, and immediately applied to me a line in which

                            composed Latin verses, and taking the paper out of my hand, he began to put the entire
                            translation into verse. He would sometimes open at hazard a prose writer, as <persName

                            changing the position of the words, and occasionally substituting others, he would
                            transmute several sentences from prose to verse, to heroic, or more commonly elegiac
                            verse, for he was particularly charmed with the graceful and easy flow of the latter,
                            with surprising rapidity <pb xml:id="I.48"/> and readiness.</q>&#8221; That he had
                        certainly arrived at great skill in the art of versification, I think I shall be able to
                        prove by the following specimens I kept among my treasures, which he gave me in 1808 or 9.

                        and what a MS.! what a free, splendid hand he wrote&#8212;was almost pure. I could wish

                        production, would give some specimens of what was a remarkable effort for a mere boy. His
                        knowledge of Greek was at that time superficial, but he, in after years, became sensible,
                        as I have often heard him say, of the great inferiority of Latin authors&#8212;of the Latin
                        language,&#8212;and learned to draw from those richer fountains which he found
                        inexhaustible&#8212;to form his lyrics <pb xml:id="I.51"/> on the Choruses of <persName

                        and his prose on <persName key="Plato327">Plato</persName>, which he considered a model of

                        regatta at which he assisted, in 1809, and seemed to enjoy with great zest, A wherry was
                        his <foreign><hi rend="italic">beau ideal</hi></foreign> of happiness, and he never lost
                        the fondness with which he regarded the Thames, no new acquaintance when he went to Eton,
                        for at Brentford we had more than once played the truant, and rowed to Kew, and once to
                        Richmond, where we saw <persName key="DoJorda1816">Mrs. Jordan</persName>, in the <name

                        life. But he had no fondness for theatrical representations; and in London, afterwards,
                        rarely went to the play. </p>

                        education <pb xml:id="I.53"/> completed, back to Field-place. We had always been much
                        together during the vacations, and constantly corresponded, and it is a matter of deep
                        regret to me that I did not preserve those letters, the tenor of which was partly literary,
                        and partly metaphysical. Such literature! and such metaphysics! both rather crude. I have a
                        vivid recollection of the walks we took in the winter of 1809. There is something in a
                        frosty day, when the sun is bright, the sky clear, and the air rarified, which acts like a
                        sort of intoxication. On such days <persName>Shelley&#8217;s</persName> spirits used to run
                        riot, his &#8220;<q>sweet and subtle talk</q>&#8221; was to me inebriating and electric. He
                        had begun to have a longing for authorship&#8212;a dim presentiment of his future
                        fame&#8212;an ambition of making a name in the world. We that winter wrote, in alternate
                        chapters, the commencement of a wild and extravagant romance, where a hideous witch played
                        the principal part, and whose portrait&#8212;not a very inviting one&#8212;is given in the

                        translations then extant of <persName key="FrSchil1805">Schiller</persName>. <persName

                        all books in all languages, and was much disappointed. He was not aware that the fragment
                        which I had accidentally found was not a separate publication, but mixed up with the works
                        of some German poet, and had been copied, I believe, from a Magazine of the day. </p>

                        at one time an idea of working out himself. But St. Leonard&#8217;s is equally famous for
                        its dragon, or serpent, of which a &#8220;<name type="title" key="TrueAndWonderfull">True

                        living affixed their signatures. Who could resist a faith in the being of a monster so well
                        certificated? Certainly <persName>Shelley</persName> was not inclined to do so, as a boy;

                    <p xml:id="ch5-1"> Many of these details may appear trivial, but they are not so to the
                        physiologist, inasmuch as they serve to show how the accidental incidents of early
                        impressions, if they did not model, influenced the direction of his mind. Admitting that
                                    &#8220;<q><foreign><hi rend="italic">Poeta nascitur, non
                        fit</hi></foreign></q>,&#8221; I am firmly persuaded of the truth of the above observation;
                        for as all animals have brains like ourselves, dependent on organization, and an
                        instructive kind of knowledge, adapted accordingly; and this instructive knowledge,
                        although perfect in its way at the first, being capable of being influenced by new and
                        altered circumstances; why should not, then, the different circumstances of early life
                        assist the character, and give the bent to a poetical imagination? Animals, as well as
                        ourselves, have intellectual qualities,&#8212;the difference is in degree, not in kind; but
                        over and above this, they must have a something superadded, to make the difference, which
                        is the faculty of taking cognizance of things wholly above the senses, of things spiritual
                        and moral&#8212;a sense <pb xml:id="I.66"/> independent of the bodily brain, independent of
                        themselves, and having a natural supremacy in the mind over and above all its other powers.
                        I do not mean to say that a <persName key="PiLapla1827">La Place</persName>, a <persName

                        education, could be reproduced, according to the <persName key="ClHelve1771"
                            >Helvetian</persName> doctrine, by following the same course, for as men are born with
                        different constitutions, features, and habits of body, mental organization must be of
                        course also differently organized. Yet no mind can be developed without preliminary
                        education, and, consequently, all the minutiæ of this education must more or less exercise
                        a modifying influence on it, as every physiologist in the natural history of animals can
                        testify. </p>

                            says:&#8212;&#8220;<q>The opinion that gold can be made, passed from the Arabs to the
                            Greeks, and from the Greeks to the rest of Europe; those who professed it, gradually
                            assumed the form of a sect, under the name of Alchymists. These Alchymists laid it down
                            as a first principle, that all metals are composed of the same materials, or that the
                            substances at least that form gold, exist in all metals, contaminated indeed by various
                            impurities, but capable of being brought to a perfect state, by purification; and hence
                            that considerable quantities of gold might be extracted from them. The generality of
                            this belief in the eastern provinces of the Roman empire, is proved by a remarkable
                            edict of <persName key="GaDiocl313">Dioclesian</persName>, quoted by <persName

                        passage: &#8220;&#8216;<q>Is it absurd to suppose this quality of amelioration in the human

                            accident, or of the slow and gradual decay of the vital powers; and that the duration
                            of the middle space, of the interval between the birth of man and his decay, will have

                            led to the gates of wisdom. I then applied myself to the cultivation of philosophy, and
                            the <pb xml:id="I.73"/>
                            <foreign><hi rend="italic">éclat</hi></foreign> with which I pursued it, exceeded my
                            most sanguine expectations. Love I cared not for, and wondered why men perversely
                            sought to ally themselves to weakness. Natural philosophy at last became the peculiar
                            science to which I directed my eager enquiries; thence I was led into a train of
                            labyrinthine meditations. I thought of <hi rend="italic">death</hi>&#8212;I shuddered
                            when I reflected, and shrunk in horror from the idea, <hi rend="italic">selfish</hi>
                            and <hi rend="italic">self-interested</hi> as I was, of entering a new existence to
                            which I was a stranger. I must either dive into the recesses of futurity, or I must
                            not&#8212;I cannot die. Will not this nature&#8212;will not this <hi rend="italic"
                                >matter</hi> of which it is composed, exist to all eternity! Ah! I know it will,
                            and by the exertion of the energies with which nature has gifted me, well I know it
                            shall. This was my opinion at that time: I then believed that there existed no God. Ah!
                            at what an exorbitant price have I bought the conviction that there is!! Believing that
                            priestcraft and superstition were all the religion which man <pb xml:id="I.74"/> ever
                            practised, it could not be supposed that I thought there existed supernatural beings of
                            any kind. I believed <hi rend="italic">Nature</hi> to be self-sufficient and excelling.
                            I supposed not, therefore, that there could be anything beyond nature. I was now about
                            seventeen; I had dived into the depths of metaphysical calculations; with sophistical
                            arguments, had I convinced myself of the non-existence of a First Cause, and by every
                            combined modification of the essences of matter, had I apparently proved that no
                            existences could possibly be, unseen by human vision.</q>&#8221; </p>

                        the volume contained were written when she was a mere child&#8212;made a powerful
                        impression on <persName>Shelley</persName>, ever enthusiastic in his admiration of talent;
                        and with a prophetic spirit he foresaw the coming greatness of that genius, which under the
                        name of <persName>Hemans</persName> afterwards electrified the world. </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch5-12"> He desired to become acquainted with the young authoress, and using my
                        name, wrote to her, as he was in the habit of doing to all those who in any way excited his
                        sympathies. This letter produced an answer, and a correspondence of some length passed
                        between them, which of course I never saw, but it is to be supposed that it turned on other
                        subjects besides poetry. I mean, that it was sceptical. It has been said by her <persName
                            key="HeChorl1872">biographer</persName>, that the poetess was at one period of her
                        life, as is the case frequently with deep thinkers on religion, inclined to doubt; and it
                        is not impossible that such owed its origin to <pb xml:id="I.85"/> this interchange of
                        thought. One may indeed suppose this to have been the case, from the circumstance of her
                            <persName key="FeBrown1827">mother</persName> writing to my <persName key="TiShell1844"
                            >father</persName>, and begging him to use his influence with <persName
                            key="PeShell1822">Shelley</persName> to cease from any further communication with her
                        daughter,&#8212;in fact, prohibiting their further correspondence. <persName
                            key="FeHeman1835">Mrs. Hemans</persName> seems, however, to have been a great admirer
                        of his poetry, and to have in some measure modelled her style after his, particularly in
                        her last and most finished effusions, in which we occasionally find a line or two of
                            <persName>Shelley&#8217;s</persName>, proving that she was an attentive reader of his
                        works. &#8220;<q>Poets,</q>&#8221; as <persName>Shelley</persName> says, &#8220;<q>the best

                            on, but of the very leaves over which they pass.</q>&#8221; </p>

                        indeed her finest lyrics were written subsequent to his death; I allude to those which

                            recollection of every one; it was proposed that we <pb xml:id="I.87"/> should ascribe
                            the poems to her. The poor woman was still living, and in green vigour, within the
                            walls of Bedlam, but since her existence must be incompatible, there could be no harm
                            in putting her to death, and in creating a nephew and administrator to his aunt&#8217;s
                            poetical works.</q>
                    </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch6-3"> &#8220;<q>The idea gave an object and purpose to our burlesque, for
                                <persName key="PeShell1822">Shelley</persName>, although of a grave disposition,
                            had a certain sly relish in a practical joke, so that it was ingenious and abstruse,
                            and of a literary nature. To ridicule the strange mixture of sentimentality with the
                            murderous fury of revolutionists, that was so powerful in the compositions of the day,
                            amused him much, and the proofs were altered again to adapt them to their new scheme,
                            but still without any notion of publication. But the bookseller was pleased with the
                            whimsical conceit, and asked to be permitted to publish the book on his own account,
                            promising inviolate secrecy, and as many copies <foreign><hi rend="italic"
                                >gratis</hi></foreign> as might be required. After some hesitation, permission was
                            granted, upon the plighted honour of the trade. In a few days, or rather in <pb
                                xml:id="I.88"/> a few hours, a noble quarto appeared,&#8212;it consisted of a small
                            number of pages, it is true, but they were of the largest size, of the thickest, the
                            whitest, and the smoothest drawing paper. The poor maniac laundress was grandly styled
                            the late <persName key="MaNicho1828">Mrs. Margaret Nicholson</persName>, widow; and the
                            sonorous name of <persName type="fiction">Fitzvictor</persName> had been culled for the
                            inconsolable nephew and administrator; and to add to his dignity, the waggish printer
                            had picked up some huge types of so unusual a form, that even an antiquary could not
                            spell the words at the first glance. The effect was certainly striking.
                                <persName>Shelley</persName> had torn open the large square bundle before the
                            printer&#8217;s boy quitted the room, and holding out a copy with his hands, he ran
                            about in an extacy of delight, gazing on the superb title-page.</q>

                            sober sadness by a society for the diffusion of that kind of knowledge which they
                            deemed useful&#8212;useful for some end which <pb xml:id="I.89"/> they have not been
                            pleased to reveal, and which unassisted reason is wholly incapable to discover. It
                            contained many odes and other pieces professing an ardent attachment to freedom, and
                            proposing to stab all who were less enthusiastic than the supposed authoress. There
                            were some verses about <hi rend="italic">sucking</hi> in them, to these I objected, as

                            indeed presumed to censure mildly certain papers, as having been thrown off in too bold
                            a vein. Nor was a certain success wanting; the remaining copies were rapidly sold in
                            Oxford, at the aristocratic price of half-a-crown per half dozen pages. We used to meet
                            gownsmen in High Street, reading the goodly volume, as-they walked, pensive, with grave
                            and sage delight,&#8212;some of them per-<pb xml:id="I.90"/>haps more pensive, because

                        regicide production was held, one can hardly conceive, in comparing this with <name

                            >Shelley</persName> says was written at 18, in 1809, that they were by the same hand.
                        Though begun, it was not completed till 1812, nor the notes appended to it till the end of
                        1811, or the beginning of the succeeding year. It has been said, though I do not affirm it,
                        that for these he was much indebted to <persName key="WiGodwi1836">Godwin</persName>; and
                        certainly the correctness, I might say the elegance of the style which they display, and
                        the mass of <pb xml:id="I.91"/> information they contain on subjects with which, in 1809,
                        he could not have been conversant, seems shew that he must have had some powerful
                        assistance in the task. <name type="title">Queen Mab</name> is undoubtedly a more
                        extraordinary effort of genius than any on record,&#8212;and when I say this, I do not
                        forget the early productions of <persName key="AlPope1744">Pope</persName>, of <persName
                            key="ThChatt1770">Chatterton</persName>, or <persName key="HeWhite1806">Kirke
                            White</persName>. It is the more wonderful when we consider, that vivid and truthful as
                        his descriptions of nature are, he had never been made familiar with her wonders. <persName
                            key="MaShell1851">Mrs. Shelley</persName> is mistaken in saying that at the period of
                        writing <name type="title">Queen Mab</name>, he had been a great traveller in England,
                        Scotland, and Ireland. In fact he had never been 50 miles from his native home, but the
                        country round Horsham is one of exceeding beauty, and imagination supplied what was wanting
                        in reality. And I have often heard him say, that a poet has an instinctive sense of the
                        truth of things, or, as he has expressed more fully the sentiment in his admirable <name

                            interpretation of a divine nature, through our own; it compels us to feel that which we
                            perceive, and to imagine that which we know; it creates anew the universe; it justifies

                            bursting. He witnessed the sufferings of the poor, and was aware of the evils of
                            ignorance. He desired to induce every rich man to despoil himself of superfluity, and
                            to erect a brotherhood of property and science, and was ready to be the first to lay
                            down the advantages of birth. He looked forward to a sort of millennium of freedom and
                            brotherhood. He saw in a fervent call on his fellow creatures to share alike the
                            blessings of the Creator, to love and serve each other, the noblest work that life and
                            time <pb xml:id="I.93"/> permitted.</q>&#8221; Such was the spirit that dictated <name

                        accounted for by his knowing that our opinions on very many of the theories, or rather
                        hypotheses, contained in that book, were as wide apart as the poles, and that he was
                        sensible that I should have strongly objected to his disseminating them. Not that, although

                        to sending copies of it to many of the writers of the day; but falling into the hands of a
                        piratical bookseller, it soon got a wide circulation from his reprint. It is certain that
                        in its present form, <persName>Shelley</persName> would never have admitted it into a

                    <p xml:id="ch6-11"> &#8220;<q>A poem, entitled <name type="title" key="PeShell1822.Mab">Queen
                                Mab</name>, was written by me at the age of eighteen, I dare say in a sufficiently
                            intemperate spirit, but even then was not intended for publication, and a few copies
                            only were struck off to be distributed among my personal friends. I have not seen this
                            production for several years. <hi rend="italic">I doubt not that it is perfectly
                                worthless in point of literary composition; that in all that concerns moral and
                                political speculations, as well as in the subtler discriminations of metaphysical
                                and religious doctrine</hi>, it is still <pb xml:id="I.95"/>
                            <hi rend="italic">more crude and immature</hi>. I am a devoted enemy to religious,
                            political, and domestic oppression, and I regret this publication, not so much from
                            literary vanity, as because I fear <hi rend="italic">it is better fitted to injure than
                                to serve the sacred cause of freedom</hi>. I have directed my solicitor to apply
                            for an injunction to restrain the sale, but after the precedent of <persName

                                key="RoSouth1843.Wat">Wat Tyler</name>&#8212;a poem written, I believe, at the same
                            age, and with the same unreflecting enthusiasm&#8212;with little hope of
                        success.</q>&#8221; </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch6-12"> I may here remark, that it is singular and unaccountable that the <persName

                        in giving publicity to this letter, which could not but have proved beneficial to
                            <persName>Shelley</persName>. He had so completely forgotten this poem of his youth,
                        that in a letter to <persName key="HoSmith1849">Mr. Horace Smith</persName>, he says,
                            &#8220;<q>If you happen to have a copy of <persName key="WiClark1829"

                                >Queen Mab</name> for me, I should like to see it. I hardly know what this poem may
                            be about. I fear it is rather rough.</q>&#8221; This letter bears date Sept. 14th,

                    <p xml:id="ch6-13"> I have marked in italics the passages in these extracts that show his
                        change of opinions&#8212;his regret of the publication as a literary composition, and his
                        fear of its tendency, although perhaps <persName key="MaShell1851">Mrs. Shelley</persName>
                        is right in including <name type="title" key="PeShell1822.Mab">Queen Mab</name> among her
                        lamented husband&#8217;s works, from its wide dissemination, and her utter inability to
                        suppress it. Everything is valuable that came from his pen, inasmuch as it assists to show
                        the progress of his master-mind, the elements on which the superstructure of his philosophy
                        was reared. I cannot help observing, <foreign><hi rend="italic">en passant</hi></foreign>,
                        that a copy of <name type="title">Queen Mab</name> was hunted out by his father-in-law, and
                        that the proceedings in Chancery, which I shall have to detail at some length, were
                        principally based on the opinions laid down in that work. </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch6-14"> But to proceed: I was acquainted with <persName key="JaLawre1840">Sir
                            Thomas Lawrence</persName>, not the great painter, but a knight of Malta, whom I met
                        first at Paris, and afterwards in London. He had purchased his knighthood in the French
                        metropolis, where <pb xml:id="I.97"/> an office was opened for the sale of these honours.
                        Nobility of origin was held as an indispensable qualification for such titles; but it would
                        seem that it was not very rigorously enforced, for in <persName>Sir
                            Thomas&#8217;s</persName> case the proofs were defective on the paternal side, and it
                        was with a consciousness of this fact that he wrote a sort of half-historical romance,
                        entitled the <name key="JaLawre1840.Empire">History of the Nairs</name>, in which he
                        endeavours to establish the supremacy of woman. </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch6-15"> When I saw him in town, he was always wading at the British Museum, in the
                        stagnant pool of genealogy, endeavouring in spite of his system, to discover the flaw in
                        his escutcheon a mistake, and when he failed in so doing, used to contend that the only
                        real nobility was in the female line. To what absurdity will not an <foreign><hi
                                rend="italic">idée fixe</hi></foreign> impart conviction, or the semblance of
                        conviction! </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch6-16"> After the publication of this strange <name type="title"
                            key="JaLawre1840.Empire">History of the Nairs</name>, he sent it with a letter to
                            <persName key="PeShell1822">Shelley</persName>, referring him to a note in <name
                            type="title" key="PeShell1822.Mab">Queen Mab</name> hostile to <pb xml:id="I.98"/>
                        matrimony, and taxing him with apostacy from his principles, in having twice entered that
                        state. This epistle produced an answer; I have not the whole of it, though it was published
                        by <persName key="JaLawre1840">Lawrence</persName>. <persName>Shelley</persName> says
                        there, &#8220;<q>I abhor seduction as much as I adore love; and if I have conformed to the
                            uses of the world on the score of matrimony, it is</q>&#8221; (the argument is
                        borrowed, by the bye, from <persName key="WiGodwi1836">Godwin</persName>, in his <name
                            type="title" key="WiGodwi1836.Memoirs">Life of Mary Wolstonecraft</name>,) &#8220;that
                        disgrace always attaches to the weaker side.&#8221; </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch6-17"> A decided anti-matrimonialist, the historian of the Nairs was by no means
                        convinced by this argument. One evening he persuaded me to accompany him to the Owenite
                        chapel, in Charlotte-street. In the ante-room, I observed a man at a table, on which were
                        laid for sale, among many works on a small scale, this <name type="title"
                            key="JaLawre1840.Empire">History of the Nairs</name>, and <name type="title"
                            key="PeShell1822.Mab">Queen Mab</name>, and after the discourse by <persName
                            key="RoOwen1858">Owen</persName>&#8212;a sort of doctrinal rather than moral essay, in
                        which he promised his disciples a millennium of roast beef and fowls, and <pb xml:id="I.99"
                        /> three or four days&#8217; recreation out of the seven, equal division of property, and
                        an universality of knowledge by education,&#8212;we had an interview with the lecturer and
                        reformer, whom I had met some years before at the house of a Northumberland lady. On
                        finding that I was connected with <persName key="PeShell1822">Shelley</persName>, he made a
                        long panegyric on him, and taking up one of the <name type="title">Queen Mabs</name> from
                        the table, read, premising that it was the basis of one of his chief tenets, the following
                        passage: </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch6-18"> &#8220;<q>How long ought the sexual connection to last? What law ought to
                            specify the extent of the grievance that should limit its duration? A husband and wife
                            ought to continue so long united as they love one another. Any law that should bind
                            them to cohabitation for one moment after the decay of their affection, would be a most
                            intolerable tyranny, and most unworthy of toleration.</q>&#8221; </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch6-19"> If <persName key="LdMelbo2">Lord Melbourne</persName> did not hold similar
                        opinions, he at least thought there was no harm in <pb xml:id="I.100"/> encouraging them,
                        by presenting <persName key="RoOwen1858">Mr. Owen</persName> to our <persName

                        with danger. This <hi rend="italic">philanthropist</hi>, however, certainly is sincere in
                        believing the contrary; and up to this time experience seems to have confirmed his belief.
                        He has spent his life, and expended his fortune in inculcating them; and a more thoroughly
                        amiable and moral man does not exist. &#8220;<q>He has had but one object in both
                            hemispheres,</q>&#8221; (to use the words of <persName key="FrBreme1865">Frederica

                            wants are satisfied, man turns to those of a more general and exalted kind. Hence, when
                            the great daywork of the earth is done with men, the Sabbath will begin, in which a

                            to the worship of the Creator in spirit and in truth. Then the day will arrive in which
                            the angels will say, &#8216;Peace upon Earth!!!&#8217;</q>&#8221; </p>

                        <persName>Brooks</persName> did, or does, live at the bottom of Oxford Street, and I paid
                        him more than one visit. He had a correspondent at Marlow, who knew <persName
                            key="PeShell1822">Shelley</persName>, but whose name I have forgotten, from whom he
                        obtained a copy of <name type="title">Queen Mab</name>, which, like the <name type="title"
                            key="PeShell1822.Wandering">Wandering Jew</name>, had probably been left by
                            <persName>Shelley&#8217;s</persName> inadvertence in his abode here. This copy was
                        exceedingly interlined, <pb xml:id="I.102"/> very much curtailed and modified, as by a
                        specimen given in a fragment entitled the &#8220;<name type="title">Demon of the

                            >Alastor</name>;&#8221; and what is still more important and worthy of remark, with the
                        Notes torn out. The copy had been revised with great care, and as though
                            <persName>Shelley</persName> had an intention at the time of bringing out a new
                        edition, an idea which his neglect of his labour shews he soon abandoned. This emendated
                        work is a great curiosity, and has scattered about the pages rude pen-and-ink drawings of
                        the most fantastic kind, proving the abstraction of his mind during this pursuit. It was a
                        comment that led me to many speculations, suggesting a deep sense of the obloquy of which
                        he had made himself the victim, and betokening a fluctuation of purpose, a hesitation and
                        doubt of himself and of the truth or policy of his theories. That <persName>Mr.
                            Brooks</persName> (he was the publisher if not the printer of the Owenites) did not

                        have thought it a sacrilege to have struck out a word of the original text, much less the
                        notes. <name type="title">Queen Mab</name> is indeed the gospel of the sect, and one of
                        them told me, that he had found a passage in Scripture, that unquestionably applied to
                            <persName>Shelley</persName>, and that the word <hi rend="italic">Shiloh</hi> was
                        pronounced in the Hebrew precisely in the same manner as his name. </p>

                            key="PeShell1822">Shelley</persName> at Oxford:&#8212;</p>

                    <p xml:id="ch7-2"> He was matriculated, and went to University <pb xml:id="I.108"/> College at
                        the commencement of Michaelmas term, at the end of October 1810. The choice of this college
                        (though a respectable one, by no means of high repute) was made by his father for two
                        reasons&#8212;first, that he had himself, as already mentioned, been a member of
                        it,&#8212;and secondly, because it numbered among its benefactors some of his ancestors,
                        one of whom had founded an Exhibition. I had left the university before he entered it, and
                        only saw him once in passing through the city. &#8220;<q>His rooms were in the corner next
                            to the hall of the principal quadrangle, on the first floor, and on the right of the
                            entrance, but by reason of the turn in the stairs, when you reach them, they will be on
                            the right hand. It is a spot, which I might venture to predict many of our posterity
                            will hereafter reverently visit, and reflect an honour on that college, which has
                            nothing so great to distinguish it.</q>&#8221; The portrait of him drawn by his
                            <persName key="ThHogg1862">friend</persName>, from whom I have borrowed largely,
                        corresponded with my recollection of him at this interview. &#8220;<q>His <pb
                                xml:id="I.109"/> figure was slight and fragile, and yet his bones and joints were
                            large and strong. He was tall, but he stooped so much, that he seemed of low
                            stature.</q>&#8221; <persName key="ThDeQui1859">De Quincey</persName> says, that he
                        remembers &#8220;<q>seeing in London, a little Indian ink sketch of him in his academical
                            costume of Oxford. The sketch tallying pretty well with a verbal description which he
                            had heard of him in some company, viz., that he looked like an elegant and slender
                            flower whose head drooped from being surcharged with rain.</q>&#8221; Where is this
                        sketch? How valuable would it be! &#8220;<q>His clothes,</q>&#8221; <persName>Mr.
                            H.</persName> adds, &#8220;<q>were expensive, and according to the most approved mode
                            of the day, but they were tumbled, rumpled, unbrushed. His gestures were abrupt,
                            sometimes violent, occasionally even awkward, yet more frequently gentle and graceful.
                            His complexion was delicate, and almost feminine, of the purest red and white, yet he
                            was tanned and freckled by exposure to the sun, having past the autumn, as he said, in
                            shooting;</q>&#8221; and he said rightly, for he had, during September, often <pb
                            xml:id="I.110"/> carried a gun in his father&#8217;s preserves; <persName
                            key="TiShell1844">Sir Timothy</persName> being a keen sportsman, and <persName
                            key="PeShell1822">Shelley</persName> himself an excellent shot, for I well remember one
                        day in the winter of 1809, when we were out together, his killing at three successive
                        shots, three snipes, to my great astonishment and envy, at the tail of the pond in front of
                        Field-place. &#8220;<q>His features, his whole face, and his head, were particularly small,
                            yet the last appeared of a remarkable bulk, for his hair was long and bushy, and in
                            fits of absence, and in the agonies (if I may use the word) of anxious thought, he
                            often rubbed it fiercely with his hands, or passed his fingers swiftly through his
                            locks, unconsciously, so that it was singularly rough and wild&#8212;a particularity
                            which he had at school. His features were not symmetrical, the mouth perhaps excepted,
                            yet was the effect of the whole extremely powerful. They breathed an animation&#8212;a
                            fire&#8212;an enthusiasm&#8212;a vivid and preternatural intelligence, that I never met
                            with in any other countenance. Nor was the moral expression less beautiful than the <pb
                                xml:id="I.111"/> intellectual, for there was a softness and delicacy, a gentleness,
                            and especially (though this will surprise many) an air of profound veneration, that
                            characterises the best works, and chiefly the frescoes (and into these they infused
                            their whole souls) of the great masters of Rome and Florence.</q>&#8221; </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch7-3"> &#8220;<q>I observed, too, the same contradiction in his rooms, which I had
                            often remarked in his person and dress. The carpet, curtain, and furniture were quite
                            new, and had not passed through several generations of students on the payment of the
                            thirds, that is, the third price last given. This general air of freshness was greatly
                            obscured by the indescribable confusion in which the various objects were mixed.
                            Scarcely a single article was in its right place&#8212;books, boots, papers, shoes,
                            philosophical instruments, clothes, pistols, linen, crockery, ammunition, and phials
                            innumerable, with money, stockings, prints, crucibles, bags, and boxes, were scattered
                            on the floor in every place, as if the young chemist, in order to analyze the mystery
                            of creation, had endeavoured <pb xml:id="I.112"/> first to reconstruct the primæval
                            chaos. The tables, and especially the carpet, were already stained with large spots of
                            various hues, which frequently proclaimed the agency of fire. An electrical machine, an
                            air pump, the galvanic trough, a solar microscope, and large glass jars and receivers,
                            were conspicuous amidst the mass of matter. Upon the table by his side, were some books
                            lying open, a bundle of new pens, and a bottle of japan ink, with many chips, and a
                            handsome razor, that had been used as a knife. There were bottles of soda-water, sugar,
                            pieces of lemon, and the traces of an effervescent beverage.</q>&#8221; </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch7-4"> Such, with some variations, was, as they come back on me, the appearance of
                            <persName key="PeShell1822">Shelley</persName> and his rooms during this visit to him
                        in the November of 1810. </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch7-5"> He had not forgotten our <persName key="AdWalke1821"
                            >Walker&#8217;s</persName> Lectures, and was deep in the mysteries of chemistry, and
                        had apparently been making some experiments; but it is highly improbable that <persName
                            key="PeShell1822">Shelley</persName> was <pb xml:id="I.113"/> qualified to succeed in
                        that science, where scrupulous minuteness and a mechanical accuracy are indispensable. His
                        chemical operations seemed to an unskilful observer to premise nothing but disasters. He
                        had blown himself up at Eton. He had inadvertently swallowed some mineral poison, which he
                        declared had seriously injured his health, and from the effects of which he should never
                        recover. His hands, his clothes, his books, and his furniture were stained and covered by
                        medical acids&#8212;more than one hole in the carpet could elucidate the ultimate phenomena
                        of combustion, especially in the middle of the room, where the floor had also been burnt by
                        his mixing ether with some other fluid in a crucible, and the honourable wound was speedily
                        enlarged by rents, for the philosopher, as he hastily crossed the room in pursuit of truth,
                        was frequently caught in it by the foot. </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch7-6"> And speaking of electricity and chemistry, <persName key="ThHogg1862">Mr.
                            Hogg</persName> says, &#8220;<q>I know little of the physical sciences, and felt
                            therefore but a slight degree of interest <pb xml:id="I.114"/> in them. I looked upon
                            his philosophical apparatus as toys and playthings, like a chess board. Through want of
                            sympathy, his zeal, which was at first ardent, gradually cooled, and he applied himself
                            to those pursuits, after a time less frequently, and with less earnestness.</q>&#8221;
                            &#8220;<q>The true value of these,</q>&#8221; <persName>Mr. H.</persName> adds,
                            &#8220;<q>was often the subject of animated discussion; and I remember one evening at
                            my rooms, when he had sought refuge from the extreme cold in the little apartment or
                            study, I referred, in the course of our debate, to a passage in <persName

                        occasion of this visit he showed me a volume of tales which he had himself rendered from
                        the original. During half an hour that we were together, (I passed the whole day with him)
                        I perused these MSS., and they gave me a very low idea of the literature of that country,
                        then almost unknown in England. It was evident <pb xml:id="I.119"/> that the books that had
                        fallen into his hands were from the pens of very inferior writers; and I told him he had
                        lost his time and labour in clothing them in his own language, and that I thought he could
                        write much better things himself. He showed and read to me many letters he had received in
                        controversies he had originated with learned divines; among the rest with a bishop, under
                        the assumed name of a woman. &#8220;<q>He had commenced this practice at Eton, and when he
                            came to Oxford he retained and extended the former practice, keeping up the ball of
                            doubt in letters, and of those he received many, so that the arrival of the postman was
                            always an anxious moment to him. This practice he had learnt of a physician, from whom
                            he had taken instructions in chemistry, and of whose character and talents he often
                            spoke with profound veneration. It was indeed the usual course with men of learning, as
                            their biographers and many volumes of such epistles testify. The physician was an old
                            man, and a man of the old <pb xml:id="I.120"/> school; he confined his epistolary
                            discussions to matters of science, and so did his disciple for a long time; but when
                            metaphysics usurped the place in his affections, that chemistry had before had, the
                            latter fell into discerptations respecting existences still more subtle than gasses and
                            the electric fluid. The transition, however, from physics to metaphysics was gradual.
                            Is the electric fluid material? he would ask his correspondent. Is light? Is the vital
                            principle in vegetables?&#8212;in the human soul? His individual character had proved
                            an obstacle to his inquiries, even whilst they were strictly physical. A refuted or
                            irritated chemist had suddenly concluded a long correspondence by telling his youthful
                            opponent that he would write to his master and have him flogged. The discipline of a
                            public school, however salutary in other respects, was not favourable to free and fair
                            discussion, and hence <persName>Shelley</persName> began to address his enquiries
                            anonymously, or rather that he might receive an answer as
                                <persName>Philalethes</persName> and the like; but even at <pb xml:id="I.121"/>
                            Eton the postman did not understand Greek, and to prevent miscarriages, therefore, it
                            was necessary to adopt a more familiar name, as <persName>John Short</persName> or

                    <p xml:id="ch7-14">
                        <persName key="PeShell1822">Shelley</persName> was an indefatigable student, frequently
                        devoting to his books ten or twelve hours of the day, and part of the night. The absorption
                        of his ideas by reading, was become in him <pb xml:id="I.123"/> a curious phenomenon. He
                        took in seven or eight lines at a glance, and his mind seized the sense with a velocity
                        equal to the twinkling of an eye. Often would a single word enable him at once to
                        comprehend the meaning of the sentence. His memory was prodigious. He with the same
                        fidelity assimilated, to use a medical term for digestion, the ideas acquired by reading
                        and those which he derived from reflection or conversation. In short, he possessed the
                        memory of places, words, things, and figures. Not only did he call up objects at will, but
                        he revived them in the mind, in the same situations, and with the lights and colours in
                        which they had appeared to him at particular moments. He collected not only the gist of the
                        thoughts in the book wherefrom they were taken, but even the disposition of his soul at the
                        time. Thus, by an unheard-of faculty and privilege, he could retrace the progress and the
                        whole course of his imagination from the most anciently sketched idea, down to its last
                        development. His brain, habituated from earliest <pb xml:id="I.124"/> youth to the
                        complicated mechanism of human forces, drew from its rich structure a crowd of admirable
                        images, full of reality and freshness, with which it was continually nurtured. He could
                        throw a veil over his eyes, and find himself in a <hi rend="italic">camera obscura</hi>,
                        where all the features of a scene were reproduced in a form more pure and perfect than they
                        had been originally presented to his external senses. </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch7-15"> &#8220;<q>As his love of intellectual pursuits was vehement, and the vigour
                            of his genius almost celestial, so were the purity and sanctity of his life most
                            conspicuous. His food was plain and simple as that of a hermit, with a certain
                            anticipation at this time of a vegetable diet, respecting which he afterwards became an
                            enthusiast in theory, and in practice an irregular votary. With his usual fondness for
                            moving the abstruse and difficult questions of the highest theology, he loved to
                            inquire, whether man can justify, on the ground of reason alone, the practice of taking
                            the life of inferior animals, except in the necessary de-<pb xml:id="I.125"/>fence of
                            his life, and of his means of life, the fruits of that field which he had tilled, from
                            violence and spoliation. Not only have considerable sects, he said, denied the right
                            altogether; but those among the tender-hearted and imaginative people of antiquity, who
                            accounted it lawful to kill and eat, appear to have doubted whether they might take
                            away life solely for the use of man alone. They slew their cattle, not simply for human
                            gusto, like the less scrupulous butchers of modern times, but only as a sacrifice for
                            the honour and in the name of the Deity, or rather of those subordinate divinities, to
                            whom as they believed the Supreme Being had assigned the creation and conservation of
                            the visible material world; as an incitement to these pious offerings, they partook of
                            the residue of the victims, of which, without such sanction and sanctification, they
                            would not have presumed to taste. So reverent was the caution of a humane and prudent
                            antiquity. Bread became his chief sustenance; when his regimen attained an austerity
                            that afterwards <pb xml:id="I.126"/> distinguished it, he could have lived on bread
                            alone, without repining. When he was walking in London, he would suddenly turn into a
                            baker&#8217;s shop, purchase a supply, and breaking a loaf, he would offer it to his
                            companion. &#8216;<q>Do you know,</q>&#8217; he said to me one day with some surprise,
                                &#8216;<q>that such a one does not like bread? Did you ever know a person who
                                disliked bread?</q>&#8217; And he told me that a friend had refused such an offer.
                            I explained to him that the individual in question probably had no objection to bread
                            in a moderate quantity, and with the usual adjuncts, and was only unwilling to devour
                            two or three pounds of dry bread in the street, and at an early hour. <persName

                            generally well stored with bread. A circle upon the carpet clearly defined by an ample
                            verge of crumbs, often marked the place where he had long sat at his studies&#8212;his
                            face nearly in contact with the book. He was near-sighted.</q>&#8221; </p>

                        all with assiduous and friendly altercations, and the latter writers at least with small
                        profit, unless some sparks of knowledge were struck out in the collision of debate. They
                        read also certain popular French works, that treat of man for the most part in a mixed
                        method, metaphysically, morally and politically. &#8220;<q>We must bear in mind, however,
                            that he was an eager, bold, and unwearied disputant, and although the position in which
                            the sceptic and materialist love to entrench themselves, offer no picturesque
                            attractions to the eye of the poet, it is well adapted <pb xml:id="I.128"/> to
                            defensive warfare, and it is not easy for an ordinary enemy to dislodge him who
                            occupies a post that derives strength from the weakness of the assailant. It has been
                            insinuated that whenever a man of real talent and generous feelings condescends to
                            fight under these colours, he is guilty of a dissimulation which he deems harmless,
                            perhaps even praiseworthy, for the sake of victory in argument. It is not a little
                            curious to observe one whose sanguine temper led him to believe implicitly every
                            assertion, so that it was impossible and incredible, exulting in his philosophical
                            doubts, when, the calmest and most suspicious of analists, he refused to admit, without
                            strict proof, propositions, that many who are not deficient in metaphysical prudence
                            account obvious and self-evident. The sceptical philosophy had another charm, it
                            partook of the new and wonderful, inasmuch as it called into doubt, and seemed to place
                            in jeopardy, during the joyous hours of disputation, many important practical
                            conclusions. To a soul loving excitement and change, destruction, <pb xml:id="I.129"/>
                            so it be on a large scale, may sometimes prove hardly less inspiring than creation. The
                            fact of the magician, who by the touch of his rod, could cause the great Pyramid to
                            dissolve into the air, and to vanish from the sight, would be as surprising as the
                            achievement of him, who by the same rod, could instantly raise a similar mass in any
                            chosen spot. If the destruction of the eternal monument was only apparent, the ocular
                            sophism would be at once harmless and ingenious; so was it with the logomachy of the
                            young and strenuous logician, and his intellectual activity merited praise and reward.
                            There was another reason, moreover, why the sceptical philosophy should be welcome to
                                <persName>Shelley</persName>,&#8212;at that time he was young, and it is generally
                            acceptable to youth. It is adopted as the abiding rule of reason, throughout life, by
                            those who are distinguished by a sterility of soul, a barrenness of invention, a total
                            dearth of fancy, and a scanty stock of learning. Such, in truth, although the warmth of
                            feverish blood, the light burthen of a few years, <pb xml:id="I.130"/> and the
                            precipitation of experience, may sometimes seem to contradict the assertion, is the
                            state of mind at the commencement of manhood, when the vessel has, as yet, received but
                            a small portion of the cargo of the accumulated wisdom of past ages; when the amount of
                            mental operations that have actually been performed is small, and the materials upon
                            which the imagination can work are insignificant; consequently, the inventions of the
                            young are crude and frigid. Hence the most fertile mind exactly resembles in early
                            youth, the hopeless barrenness of those, who have grown old in vain, as to its actual
                            condition, and it differs only in the unseen capacity for future production. The
                            philosopher who declares that he knows nothing, and that nothing can be known, will
                            readily find followers among the young, for they are sensible that they possess the
                            requisite qualification for entering the school, and are as far advanced in the science
                            of ignorance as their master. A stranger who had chanced to have been present at some
                            of <persName>Shelley&#8217;s</persName> disputes, or who <pb xml:id="I.131"/> knew him
                            only from having read some of the short argumentative essays which he composed as
                            voluntary exercises, would have said, &#8216;Surely the soul of
                                <persName>Hume</persName> passed by transmigration into the body of that eloquent
                            young man, or rather he represents one of the enthusiastic and animated materialists of
                            the French school, whom revolutionary violence lately intercepted at an early age in
                            his philosophical career.&#8217;</q>

                    <p xml:id="ch7-17"> &#8220;<q>There were times, however, when a visitor who had listened to the
                            glowing discourses delivered with a more intense ardour, would have hailed a young
                            Platonist breathing forth the ideal philosophy, and in his pursuit of the intellectual
                            world, entirely overlooking the material, or noticing it only to contemn it. The tall
                            boy, who is permitted, for the first time, to scare the partridges with his fowling
                            piece, scorns to handle the top or the hoop of his younger brother; thus the man, whose
                            years and studies are mature, slights the feeble aspirations after the higher
                            departments of knowledge that were <pb xml:id="I.132"/> deemed so important during his
                            residence at college. It seems laughable, but it is true, his knowledge of <persName
                                key="Plato327">Plato</persName> was derived solely from <persName key="AnDacie1720"
                                >Dacier&#8217;s</persName> translation of a few of the Dialogues, and from an
                            English version of that French translation. Since that time, however, few of his
                            countrymen have read the golden works of that majestic philosopher in the original
                            language, more frequently, and more carefully; and few, if any, with more profit than
                                <persName key="PeShell1822">Shelley</persName>. Although the source whence flowed
                            his earliest taste of the divine philosophy was scanty and turbid, the draught was not
                            the less grateful to his lips. <persName>Shelley</persName> was never tired of reading
                            passages from the dialogues contained in this collection, especially from the <name
                                key="Plato327.Phaedo">Phædo</name>, and he was vehemently excited by the striking
                            doctrines which <persName key="Socra399">Socrates</persName> unfolds, especially by
                            that which teaches, that all our knowledge consists of reminiscences of what we had
                            learnt in a former existence. He often even paced about his room, slowly shook his wild
                            locks, and discoursed in a solemn tone with a <pb xml:id="I.133"/> mysterious air,
                            speculating concerning our previous condition, and of the nature of our life and
                            occupations in the world, where, according to <persName>Plato</persName>, we had
                            attained to erudition, and had advanced ourselves in knowledge, so that the most
                            studious and the most inventive, in other words, those who have the best memory, are
                            able to call back a part only, and with much pain, and extreme difficulty, of what was
                            familiar to us.</q>&#8221; </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch7-18"> This doctrine, introduced by <persName key="Pytha500"
                        >Pythagoras</persName>, after his travels in India, and derived from the Gymnosophists, was
                        received almost without question by several of the philosophers of Greece; and long before
                            <persName key="PeShell1822">Shelley</persName> went to Oxford, had taken deep root in
                        his mind, for he had found it in <persName key="SaColer1834">Coleridge</persName> and
                        introduced it into the <name type="title" key="PeShell1822.Wandering">Wandering Jew</name>.
                        That <persName>Shelley</persName> should have been delighted in finding it unfolded in the
                            <name type="title" key="Plato327.Phaedo">Phædo</name>, I can easily believe. It was a
                        doctrine that vindicated the justice of the Gods; for, by it, the inequalities of
                        conditions, the comparative misery and happiness of individuals, were reconciled to the
                        mind, <pb xml:id="I.134"/> such individuals being rewarded or punished in this life for
                        good or evil deeds committed in a former state of existence. The objection, that we have no
                        memory of that state, is answered by the question, &#8220;<q>Does a child of two years old
                            remember what passed when he was a year old?</q>&#8221; But it is
                            <persName>Shelley&#8217;s</persName> opinion that it is permitted to some gifted
                        persons to have glimpses of the past, and he thus records it: </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch7-19"> &#8220;<q>I have beheld scenes, with the intimate and unaccountable
                            connection of which with the obscure parts of my own nature, I have been irresistibly
                            impressed. I have beheld a scene that has produced no unusual effect on my thoughts.
                            After a lapse of many years I have dreamed of this scene. It has hung on my memory, it
                            has haunted my thoughts at intervals with the pertinacity of an object connected with
                            human affections. I have visited this scene again. Neither the dream could be
                            dissociated from the landscape, nor the landscape from the dream, nor feelings such as
                            neither singly could have <pb xml:id="I.135"/> awakened from both. But the most
                            remarkable event of this nature which ever occurred to me, happened at Oxford. I was
                            walking with a friend in the neighbourhood of that city, engaged in earnest and
                            interesting conversation; we suddenly turned a corner of a lane, and the view, which
                            its high banks and hedges had concealed, presented itself. The view consisted of a
                            windmill, standing in one among many pleasing meadows, inclosed with stone walls. The
                            irregular and broken ground between the wall and the road in which we stood, a long low
                            hill behind the windmill, and a grey covering of uniform cloud spread over the evening
                            sky. It was that season when the last leaf had just fallen from the scant and stunted
                            ash. The scene surely was a common one, the season and the hour little calculated to
                            kindle lawless thought. It was a tame and uninteresting assemblage of objects, such as
                            would drive the imagination for refuge in serious and sober talk to the evening
                            fireside and the dessert of winter fruits and wine. The effect <pb xml:id="I.136"/>
                            which it produced on me was not such as could be expected. I suddenly remembered to
                            have seen the exact scene in some dream of long.&#8212;Here I was obliged to leave off,
                            overcome with thrilling horror.</q>&#8221; <persName key="MaShell1851">Mrs.

                            fragment was written in 1815. I remember well his coming to me from writing it, pale
                            and agitated, to seek refuge in conversation from the fearful emotions it
                        excited.</q>&#8221; &#8220;<q>No man,</q>&#8221; she adds, &#8220;<q>had such keen

                            was wound up by the delicacy of his health to an intense degree of sensibility; and
                            while his active mind pondered for ever upon, and drew conclusions from his sensations,
                            his reveries increased their vivacity, till they mingled with and were one with
                            thought, and both became absorbing and tumultuous, even to physical pain.</q>&#8221; </p>

                            me,&#8212;&#8216;I have seen all this last night in dream.&#8217; He recognised the
                            grove of trees under which we were, and the disposition of the foliage, the colour of
                            the water, the turrets of the chateau, the lights and shades, the distances, in fine
                            all the details of the spot which we had then perceived for the first time.</q>&#8221;
                        After some interesting conversation, which would occupy too much space here,
                            <persName>Balzac</persName> makes <persName type="fiction">Louis Lambert</persName>
                            say,&#8212;&#8220;<q>&#8216;If the landscape did not come to me, which it is absurd to
                            think, then must I have come to it. If I were here whilst I slept, does not this fact
                            constitute a complete separation between my body and inward being? Does it not form a
                            locomotive <pb xml:id="I.138"/> faculty in the soul, or effects that are equivalent to
                            locomotive? Thus, if the disunion of our two natures could take place during sleep, why
                            could they not equally discover themselves when awake?&#8217; &#8216;Is there not an
                            entire science in this phenomenon,&#8217; added he, striking his forehead. &#8216;If it
                            be not the principle of a science, it certainly betrays a singular faculty in
                            man.&#8217;</q>&#8221; </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch8-1"> To return, however, to <persName key="PeShell1822">Shelley</persName> and
                        Oxford. &#8220;<q>It is hazardous to speak of his earlier efforts as a Platonist, lest they
                            should be confounded with his subsequent advancement; it is not easy to describe his
                            first introduction to the exalted wisdom of antiquity, without borrowing inadvertently
                            from the knowledge which he afterwards acquired. The cold, ungenial, foggy atmosphere
                            of northern metaphysics was less suited to the ardent temperament of his soul than the
                            warm, vivifying climate of the southern and eastern philosophy. His genius expanded
                            under the benign influence of the latter, and he derived copious instruction from a
                            luminous system that <pb xml:id="I.139"/> is only dark through excess of brightness,
                            and seems obscure to vulgar vision through its extreme radiance.</q>&#8221; On this
                        subject I shall have hereafter much to say. Nevertheless, for the present I will repeat,
                        that &#8220;<q>in argument, and to argue on all questions was his dominant passion. He
                            usually adopted the scheme of the Sceptics; partly because it was more popular, and is
                            more generally understood. The disputant who would use <persName key="Plato327"
                                >Plato</persName> as a text-book in this age, would reduce his opponents to a small
                            number indeed.</q>&#8221; It was in this spirit, that, in conjunction with his friend
                        (for it was the production of both), in their everyday studies they made up a little book
                        entitled, &#8220;<name type="title" key="PeShell1822.Necessity">The Necessity of
                            Atheism</name>,&#8221; and had it printed, I believe in London&#8212;certainly not at
                        Oxford. This little pamphlet was never offered for sale. It was not addressed to an
                        ordinary reader, but to the metaphysical alone; and it was so short, that it was only
                        designed to point out the line of argument. It was, in truth, a general issue, a
                        compendious denial of every al-<pb xml:id="I.140"/>legation in order to put, the whole case
                        in proof. It was a formal mode of saying,&#8212;&#8220;<q>You affirm so and so,&#8212;then
                            prove it.</q>&#8221; And thus was it understood by his more candid and intelligent
                        correspondents. As it was shorter, so was it plainer, and perhaps, in order to provoke
                        discussion, a little bolder than <persName key="DaHume1776"
                            >Hume&#8217;s</persName>&#32;<name type="title" key="DaHume1776.Miracles"
                        >Essays</name>&#8212;a book which occupies a conspicuous place in the library of every
                        student. The doctrine, if not deserving the name, was precisely similar&#8212;the necessary
                        and inevitable consequence of <persName key="JoLocke1704">Locke&#8217;s</persName>
                        philosophy, and the theory, that all knowledge is from without. </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch8-2"> I will not admit your conclusions, his opponent might answer.&#8212;Then you
                        must deny those of <persName key="DaHume1776">Hume</persName>.&#8212;I deny them.&#8212;But
                        you must deny those of <persName key="JoLocke1704">Locke</persName> also; and we will go
                        back together to <persName key="Plato327">Plato</persName>. Such was the usual course of
                        argument. Sometimes, however, he rested on mere denial, holding his adversary to strict
                        proof, and deriving strength from his weakness. But those who are anxious to see this
                        syllabus, may <pb xml:id="I.141"/> find it <foreign><hi rend="italic">totidem

                    <p xml:id="ch8-3"> This syllabus he sent to me among many others, and circulated it largely
                        among the heads of colleges, and professors of the university, forwarding copies it is said
                        to several of the bishops. The author of <name type="title" key="ThDeQui1859.Confessions"
                            >The Opium Eater</name> says that <persName key="PeShell1822">Shelley</persName> put
                        his name to the pamphlet, and the name of his college. The publication was anonymous; but
                        the secret (scarcely made a secret) of the authorship soon transpired. I wish I could also
                        confirm <persName key="ThDeQui1859">Mr. De Quincy&#8217;s</persName> observation, that
                            <persName>Shelley</persName> had but just entered his sixteenth year; he was in his
                        nineteenth. Still, however, <persName>Shelley</persName> was a thoughtless boy at this era,
                        and not a man. The promulgation of this syllabus was a reckless&#8212;a mad act. </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch8-4"> The consequence might be anticipated. &#8220;<q>It was a fine spring

                            enquired what had happened: &#8216;I am expelled!&#8217; he said, as soon as he had
                            recovered himself a little,&#8212;&#8216;I am expelled! I was sent for suddenly, a few
                            minutes ago,&#8212;I went to the common room, where I found our master and two or three
                            of his fellows. The master produced a copy of the little <name type="title"

                            purpose they put the question,&#8212;no answer was given, but the master loudly and
                            angrily repeated, &#8216;Are you the author of this <note place="foot">

                            such unworthy treatment. I told him calmly, but firmly, that I was determined not to

                            demand; I persisted in my refusal, and he said, furiously, &#8216;Then you are

                            and courage, frank and fearless, but he was likewise shy, unpresuming, and eminently
                            sensitive; I have been with him on many trying occasions of his after life, but I never
                            saw him so deeply shocked and so cruelly agitated as on this occasion. A nice sense of
                            honour shrinks from the most distant touch of disgrace&#8212;even from the insults of
                            those men whose contumely can bring no shame. He sat on the sofa, repeating with
                            convulsive vehemence the word &#8216;Expelled! Expelled!&#8217; his head shaking with

                        and whom he accuses of denouncing <persName key="PeShell1822">Shelley</persName>, did not
                        first attempt to refute his arguments, or this failing, that he had not left the correction
                        of his errors to time and <pb xml:id="I.145"/> good sense. I had once a conversation with a
                        German Professor, who expressed his astonishment at this laconic fiat, and said, that had
                            <persName>Shelley</persName> promulgated this <name type="title"
                            key="PeShell1822.Necessity">Syllabus</name> at any of their universities, he would have
                        found Divines enough to have entered the lists with him, adding, that had not the young
                        collegian been convinced, he would not have drawn from what he deemed intolerance and
                        persecution, an obstinate adherence to his errors, from a belief that his logic was
                        unanswerable. </p>

                        and distinguished talents, promising to reflect credit on the college; but because, as I
                        have said, his father had been a member of it, his ancestors its benefactors. I know not if
                        these considerations had any weight with the conclave, but it appears that

                        <pb xml:id="I.146"/> was by no means in good odour with the authorities of the college,
                        from the side he took in the election of <persName key="LdGrenv1">Lord

                        all, in behalf of the scholar and liberal statesman. Plain and loud was the avowal of his
                        sentiments, nor were they confined to words, for he published, I think in the <name

                        by the heads of the college. It was a well-written paper, and calculated to produce some
                        effect; and as he expressed himself eminently delighted at the issue of the

                        seclusion of academic groves and gardens, and the calm valley of the silvery Isis, to the
                        stormy ocean of that vast and shoreless world, and to the utmost violence of which, he was,
                        at an early age, suddenly and unnaturally abandoned. </p>

                        the news, having been led to augur such a close to his collegiate career, from the <name

                        avowal of his scepticism. My apprehensions, too, of the consequences of this unhappy event,
                        from my knowledge of <persName key="TiShell1844">Sir Timothy&#8217;s</persName> character,
                        were soon confirmed; nor was his <persName key="ThHogg1862">partner</persName> in
                        misfortune doomed to a milder fate. Their fathers refused to receive them under their
                        roofs. Like the old men in <persName key="PuTeren">Terence</persName>, they compared notes,
                        and hardened each other&#8217;s hearts. This unmitigable hatred was continued down to the
                        deaths of both. One had not the power of carrying his worldly resentment beyond the grave,
                        but the other not only never forgave, or I believe ever would see his eldest son, (for such
                        he was, and presumptive heir to a large fortune) but cut him off, <pb xml:id="I.149"/>
                        speaking after the manner of the Roman law, with a shilling. </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch8-13"> During <persName key="PeShell1822">Shelley&#8217;s</persName> ostracism, he
                        and his friend took a lodging together, where I visited them, living as best they could.
                        Good arises out of evil. Both owe, perhaps, to this expulsion, their celebrity; one has
                        risen to an eminence as a lawyer, which he might never have attained, and the other has
                        made himself a name which will go down to posterity with those of <persName

                    <p xml:id="ch8-14"> At this time <persName key="PeShell1822">Shelley</persName> was ever in a
                        dreamy state, and he told me he was in the habit of noting down his dreams. The first day,
                        he said, they amounted to a page, the next to two, the third to several, till at last they
                        constituted the greater part of his existence; realising <persName key="PeCalde1681"
                            >Calderon&#8217;s</persName>&#32;<name type="title" key="PeCalde1681.Vida"><hi
                                rend="italic">Sueno e Sueno</hi></name>. One morning he told me he was satisfied of
                        the existence of two sorts of dreams, the Phrenic and the Psychic; and that he had
                        witnessed a singular phenomenon, proving that the mind and the soul were separate and
                            differ-<pb xml:id="I.150"/>ent entities&#8212;that it had more than once happened to
                        him to have a dream, which the mind was pleasantly and actively developing; in the midst of
                        which, it was broken off by a dream within a dream&#8212;a dream of the soul, to which the
                        mind was not privy; but that from the effect it produced&#8212;the start of horror with
                        which he waked, must have been terrific. It is no wonder that, making a pursuit of dreams,
                        he should have left some as a catalogue of the phenomena of dreams, as connecting sleeping
                        and waking. </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch8-15"> &#8220;<q>I distinctly remember,</q>&#8221; he says, &#8220;<q>dreaming
                            several times, between the intervals of two or three years, the same precise dream. It
                            was not so much what is ordinarily called a dream: The single image, unconnected with
                            all other images, of a youth who was educated at the same school with myself, presented
                            itself in sleep. Even now, after a lapse of many years, I can never hear the name of
                            this youth, without the three places where I dreamed of him presenting themselves
                            distinctly to my mind.</q>&#8221; And again, <pb xml:id="I.151"/> &#8220;<q>in dreams,
                            images acquire associations peculiar to dreaming; so that the idea of a particular
                            house, when it occurs a second time in dreams, will have relation with the idea of the
                            same house in the first time, of a nature entirely different from that which the house
                            excites when seen or thought of in relation to waking ideas.</q>&#8221; </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch8-16"> His systematising of dreams, and encouraging, if I may so say, the habit of
                        dreaming, by this journal, which he then kept, revived in him his old somnambulism. As an
                        instance of this, being in Leicester Square one morning at five o&#8217;clock, I was
                        attracted by a group of boys collected round a well-dressed person lying near the rails. On
                        coming up to them, my curiosity being excited, I descried <persName key="PeShell1822"
                            >Shelley</persName>, who had unconsciously spent a part of the night <foreign><hi

                    <p xml:id="ch8-17"> We took during the spring frequent walks in the Parks, and on the banks of
                        the Serpentine. He was fond of that classical recreation, as it appears by a fragment from
                        some comic drama of <pb xml:id="I.152"/>
                        <persName key="Aesch456">Æschylus</persName>, of making &#8220;ducks and drakes,&#8221;
                        counting with the utmost glee the number of bounds, as the flat stones flew skimming over
                        the surface of the water; nor was he less delighted with floating down the wind, paper
                        boats, in the constructing of which, habit had given him a wonderful skill. He took as
                        great interest in the sailing of his frail vessels as a ship-builder may do in that of his
                        vessels&#8212;and when one escaped the dangers of the winds and waves, and reached in
                        safety the opposite shore, he would run round to hail the safe termination of its voyage.

                        persecution, and the belief that the logic of his <name type="title"
                            key="PeShell1822.Necessity">Syllabus</name> had been unrespected because it could not

                        had begun to discard for <persName key="Plato327">Plato</persName>, and would, but for his
                        expulsion, have soon entirely abandoned. He reverted to his <name type="title"

                        converted what was a mere imaginative poem into a systematic attack on the institutions of
                        society. He not only corrected the versification with great care, but more than doubled its
                        length, and appended to the text the Notes, which were at that time scarcely, if at all
                        begun. The intolerance of the members of a religion, which should be that of love and
                        charity and long-suffering, in his own case, made him throw the odium on the creed itself;
                        and he argues that it is ever a proof that the falsehood of a proposition is felt by those
                        who use coercion, not reasoning, to procure its admission, and adds, that a dispassionate
                        observer would feel himself <pb xml:id="I.154"/> more powerfully interested in favour of a

                        and never have I seen him read a newspaper, incredible as it may appear to those who pass

                        advancement&#8212;a stepping-stone to political power. After <persName>Percy
                            Bysshe&#8217;s</persName> expulsion, he took a hatred to books, and even carried his
                        animosity to education so far that he never employed a steward who could read or write. He
                        was an enemy to the instruction of the children of the poor, and on the occasion of his
                            <persName key="JoShell1866">younger son&#8217;s</persName> going to school, said to

                        happiness split. Further communication with <persName key="HaHelya1867">Miss
                            Grove</persName> was prohibited; and he had the heartrending agony of soon knowing that
                        she was lost to him for ever. <persName key="LdByron">Byron&#8217;s</persName> whole life
                        is said to have received its bias from love&#8212;from his blighted affection for <persName
                            key="MaMuste1832">Miss Chaworth</persName>. There was a similarity in the fates of the
                        two poets; but the effects were different: <persName>Byron</persName> sought for refuge in
                        dissipation, and gave vent to his feelings in satire. He looked upon the world as his
                        enemy, and visited what he deemed the wrong of one, on his species at large.
                            <persName>Shelley</persName>, on the contrary, with the goodness of a noble mind,
                        sought by a more enlarged philosophy to dull the edge of his own miseries, and in the
                            sympa-<pb xml:id="I.163"/>thy of a generous and amiable nature for the sufferings of
                        his kind, to find relief and solace for a disappointment which in
                            <persName>Byron</persName> had only led to wilful exaggeration of its own despair.
                            <persName>Shelley</persName>, on this trying occasion, had the courage to live, in
                        order that he might labour for one great object, the advancement of the human race, and the
                        amelioration of society, and strengthened himself in a resolution to devote his energies to
                        this ultimate end, being prepared to endure every obloquy, to make any sacrifice for its
                        accomplishment; and would, if necessary, have died for the cause. He had the ambition, thus
                        early manifested, of becoming a reformer; for one Sunday, after we had been to <persName
                            key="RoHill1833">Rowland Hill&#8217;s</persName> chapel, and were dining together in
                        the city, he wrote to him under an assumed name, proposing to preach to his congregation.
                        Of course he received no answer. Had he applied to <persName key="ThCarly1881"
                            >Carlisle</persName> or <persName key="RoOwen1858">Owen</persName>, perhaps the reply
                        would have been affirmative. But he had perhaps scarcely heard of their names or doctrines,
                        even if they had commenced their career. </p>

                        with <persName key="HaShell1816">Miss Westbrook</persName>. The father, who was in easy
                        circumstances, kept an hotel in London, and sent his daughter to a school at Balam Hill,
                        where <persName key="PeShell1822">Shelley&#8217;s</persName> second sister made one of the
                        boarders. It so happened, that as <persName>Shelley</persName> was walking in the garden of
                        this seminary, <persName>Miss Westbrook</persName> past them. She was a handsome blonde,
                        not then sixteen. <persName>Shelley</persName> was so struck with her beauty, that after
                        his habit of writing, as in the case of <persName key="FeHeman1835">Felicia
                            Browne</persName> and others, to ladies who interested him, he contrived, through the
                        intermediation of his sister, to carry on a correspondence with her. The intimacy was not
                        long in ripening. The young lady was nothing loth to be wooed, and after a period of only a
                        few weeks, <pb xml:id="I.166"/> it was by a sort of knight-errantry that
                            <persName>Shelley</persName> carried her off from Chapel-street, Grosvenor-square,
                        where she sorely complained of being subject to great oppression from her sister and
                        father. Whether this was well or ill-founded, is little to the purpose to enquire.
                        Probably, <persName>Shelley</persName> and <persName>Miss Harriett
                        Westbrook</persName>&#8212;there might have been some magic in the name of

                        elopement; they were totally unacquainted with each other&#8217;s dispositions, habits, or
                        pursuits; and took a rash step, that none but a mere boy and girl would have taken. Well
                        might it be termed an ill-judged and ill-assorted union,&#8212;bitter were destined to be
                        its fruits. </p>

                        profound secret, nor in any way alluded to it in any correspondence, nor was it even
                        guessed at by <persName key="ChGrove1878">Dr. Grove</persName>, in whose house he was

                        did he throw out a hint on the subject. Authors make the strangest matches. It was at the
                        end of August, 1811, that the youthful pair set oat to Gretna Green, where they were united
                        after the formula, which, as we have lately had so circumstantial an account of the
                        ceremony, I shall not repeat, though he many years after detailed it to me, with other
                        particulars not therein included. From thence the &#8220;new-married couple&#8221; betook
                        themselves to Edinburgh. Their stay in that city was short; for by a letter dated
                        Cuckfield, the residence of an uncle, of the 21 Oct, 1811, he says,&#8212;&#8220;<q>In the

                                    wish to have a house in Sussex. Perhaps you could look out for one for us. Let

                                    without any exorbitant interest, until my coming of age? I hear that you and my

                                    always hate those whom they have injured; this hatred was, I suppose, a

                        Keswick, on the Penrith road, which they had been induced to take by one of their new

                            <persName>De Quincey</persName> says, that he might have placed some neighbourly

                        further,&#8212;finally, his own library, which being rich in the wickedest of German

                        Italy,&#8212;came to Dublin. Ireland was then, as ever, in a disturbed condition, and with

                        public meetings, where he displayed that eloquence for which he was remarkable, and which
                        would doubtless have distinguished him, had he embarked in a political career in the
                        senate. Nor did he confine himself to speeches. In a letter dated from No. 17, Grafton
                        Street, of the date of the 10th March, 1812, he says, &#8220;<q>I am now engaged with a
                                <persName key="JoLawle1837">literary friend</persName> in the publication of a
                            voluminous <name type="title" key="JoLawle1837.Compendium">History of Ireland</name>,
                            of which 250 pages are already printed, and for the completion of which, I wish to
                            raise £250; I could obtain undeniable security for its payment at the expiration of
                            eighteen months. Can you tell me how I ought to proceed! The work will produce great
                            profits.</q>&#8221; Who his coadjutor was I know not; but it would seem that the
                        History of Ireland was abandoned for a pamphlet on the state of the country, which he sent
                        me. It was rather a book than a <name type="title" key="PeShell1822.Address"
                            >pamphlet</name>, closely and cheaply printed, very ill-digested, but abounding in
                        splendid passages. The tenor of it was by no <pb xml:id="I.176"/> means violent, and, I
                        remember well, suggested a policy which has been since so successfully adopted by the great
                            <hi rend="italic">agitating Pacificator</hi>,&#8212;a policy which
                            <persName>Shelley</persName> laid down in one of his letters many years afterwards,
                        where he says:&#8212;&#8220;<q>The great thing to do is to hold the balance between popular
                            impatience and tyrannical obstinacy, and inculcate with fervour, both the right of
                            resistance, and the duty of forbearance. You know my principles incite me to take all
                            the good I can get in politics, for ever aspiring to something more. I am one of those
                            whom nothing will fully satisfy, but who are ready to be partially satisfied with all
                            that is practicable.</q>&#8221; </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch9-21"> A friend of mine in Dublin has searched among the innumerable pamphlets in
                        the public library there, for this, but in vain. It was a straw that has doubtless been
                        carried down the current and lost. </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch9-22"> His departure from Ireland was occasioned, as he told me, by a hint from
                        the police, and he in haste took refuge in the Isle of Man&#8212;that then <pb

                        <foreign><hi rend="italic">imperium in imperio</hi></foreign>, that extrajudical place,
                        where the debtor was safe from his creditor, and the political refugee found an asylum in
                        his obscurity from the myrmidons of the law. He remained, however, at Douglas but a short
                        time, and on his passage to some port in Wales, had a very narrow escape from his fatal
                        element. He had embarked in a small trading vessel which had only three hands on board. It
                        was the month of November, and the weather, boisterous when they left the harbour,
                        increased to a dreadful gale. The skipper attributed to <persName key="PeShell1822"
                            >Shelley&#8217;s</persName> exertions, so much the safety of the vessel, that he
                        refused on landing to accept his fare. </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch9-23"> &#8220;After all these, and many other wanderings, we find <persName
                            key="PeShell1822">Shelley</persName> at Rhayader, Radnorshire. Its vicinity to Combe
                        Ellen, (which <persName key="WiBowle1850">Bowles</persName> has immortalised) the residence
                        of his cousin, <persName key="ThGrove1824">Thomas Grove</persName>, probably led him to
                        desire to fix himself in that neighbourhood, and he selected Nantzwillt. In a letter dated
                        April 25th, 1812, he expresses a de-<pb xml:id="I.178"/>sire to take a lease of the place,
                        and says,&#8212;&#8220;<q>So eligible an opportunity for settling in a cheap, retired,
                            romantic spot, will scarcely occur again.</q>&#8221; But how was he to purchase the
                        stock of two hundred acres of ground, and pay a rent of ninety-eight pounds a year? In fact
                        he soon perceived the incompetency of his means for such an undertaking. It was after this
                        period, that he settled himself in a cottage belonging to <persName key="WiMadoc1828">Mr.
                            Maddocks</persName>, in Caernarvonshire. <persName>Shelley</persName> was of opinion,
                        that for some time after he had left Ireland, he was under the surveillance of the police,
                        and that his life was in danger from its emissaries; doubtless, a most erroneous notion,
                        but one which the total sequestration, and wild solitude of the country, contributed to
                        render an <foreign><hi rend="italic">idèe fixe</hi></foreign>. </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch9-24"> I knew <persName key="WiMadoc1828">Mr. Maddocks</persName> well, and had
                        many conversations with him at Florence as to a circumstance that occurred, or which
                            <persName key="PeShell1822">Shelley</persName> supposed did occur, in North Wales. The
                        horrors of the inn in &#8220;<name type="title" key="ToSmoll1771.Fathom">Count
                            Fathom</name>,&#8221; were hardly sur-<pb xml:id="I.179"/>passed by the recital
                            <persName>Shelley</persName> used to make of this scene. The story as dictated by him
                        was simply this:&#8212;At midnight, sitting alone in his study on the ground floor, he
                        heard a noise at the window, saw one of the shutters gradually unclosed, and a hand
                        advanced into the room armed with a pistol. The muzzle was directed towards him, the aim
                        taken, the weapon cocked, and the trigger drawn. The trigger missed fire.
                            <persName>Shelley</persName>, with that personal courage which particularly
                        distinguished him, rushed out in order to discover and seize the assassin. As he was in the
                        act of passing through the outer door, at the entrance of an avenue leading into the
                        garden, he found himself face to face with the ruffian, whose pistol missed fire a second
                        time. This opponent he described as a short, stout, powerful man.
                            <persName>Shelley</persName>, though slightly built, was tall, and though incapable of
                        supporting much fatigue, and seeming evidently weak, had the faculty in certain moments of
                        evoking extraordinary powers, and concentrating all his <pb xml:id="I.180"/> energies to a
                        given point. This singular phenomenon, which has been noticed in others, he displayed on
                        this occasion; and it made the aggressor and <persName>Shelley</persName> no unequal match.
                        It was a contest between mind and matter, between intellectual and brute force. After long
                        and painful wrestling, the victory was fast declaring itself for moral courage, which his
                        antagonist perceiving, extricated himself from his grasp, darted into the grounds, and
                        disappeared among the shrubbery. <persName>Shelley</persName> made a deposition the next
                        day before the magistrate, <persName>Mr. Maddocks</persName>, of these facts. An attempt to
                        murder caused a great sensation in that part of the principality, where not even a robbery
                        had taken place for several years. No solution could be found for the enigma; and the
                        opinion generally was that the whole was a nightmare&#8212;a horrid dream, tho effect of an
                        overheated imagination. The savage wildness of the scenery&#8212;the entire isolation of
                        the place&#8212;the profound metaphysical speculations in which
                            <persName>Shelley</persName> was absorbed&#8212;the want <pb xml:id="I.181"/> of sound
                        and wholesome reading, and the ungeniality of his companions (for he had one besides his
                        wife, a spinster of a certain age for a humble companion to her)&#8212;all combined to
                        foster his natural bent for the visionary, and confirm <persName>Mr.
                            Maddocks&#8217;s</persName> idea, that the events of that horrible night were a
                        delusion. <persName key="ElHitch1822">This lady</persName>, who had accompanied the young

                        tears ran down his cheek. She perpetrated an ode, proving that she was a great stickler for
                        the rights of her sex, the first line of which ran thus:&#8212; <q>

                            >Shelley&#8217;s</persName> with an individual neither adapted to his conditional life,
                        nor fitted for his companionship by accomplishments or manners, it is surprising, not that
                        it should have ended in a separation, <pb xml:id="I.186"/> but that for so long a time,
                        (for time is not to be calculated by years,) he should have continued to drag on a chain,
                        every link of which was a protraction of torture. </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch10-5"> It was not without mature deliberation, and a conviction common to both, of
                        their utter incapacity of rendering the married state bearable to each other, that they
                        came to a resolve, which, the cold, formal English world, with its conventionalities, under
                        any circumstances short of legally proved infidelity, stamps as a dereliction of duty on
                        the side of the man. Ours is the only country where the yoke of marriage, when it is an
                        iron one, weighs down and crushes those who have once thrown it over their necks. It may be
                        compared to the leaden mantle in the <name type="title" key="DaAligh.Inferno"
                            >Inferno</name>. It is true that the Roman Catholic religion in some countries, such as
                        Italy and France, except by the express permission, rarely obtained, (though it was in the
                        case of the <persName key="TeGuicc1873">Countess Guiccioli</persName>,) of the Pope, does
                        not allow divorces; but separations, tantamount to them, <pb xml:id="I.187"/> constantly
                        take place by mutual agreement, without placing the parties in a false position as regards
                        society. Spain has emancipated herself from the inextricability of the chain. In Poland and
                        Russia remarriages are of daily occurrence. But let us look into Protestant lands, for we
                        are yet Protestants, and we shall find that inmost of the states in Germany, nothing is
                        easier than to dissolve the tie. The marriage laws in Prussia are very liberal. In Norway
                        the parties cannot be disunited under three years. In Sweden one year&#8217;s notice
                        suffices. But with us, not even confirmed insanity is sufficient to dissolve a marriage!
                        Our laws admit of but one ground for divorces, and who with any fine feeling would like to
                        drag through the mire of public infamy, her who had once been dear to him&#8212;the mother,
                        perhaps, of his children? How long will our statute-book continue to uphold this barbarous

                            <persName>Lady Byron</persName>, against his will, after a short trial,&#8212;less than
                        twelve months; <persName>Shelley</persName> and his wife parted by mutual consent, after a
                        much longer test of the incompatibility of their tempers, and incapacity to render the
                        duration <pb xml:id="I.195"/> of their union anything but an intolerable tyranny; and it
                        must not be forgotten, too, that isolation from society made them perfectly acquainted with
                        each other&#8217;s dispositions and habits and pursuits. In both cases the world ranged
                        itself on the weaker side; but if <persName>Byron</persName> had his measure of reproach
                        and defamation, <persName>Shelley</persName> was persecuted with a more exceeding amount of
                        obloquy, driven from his native land, placed under a ban by his friends and relations, and
                        considered, as he says, &#8220;<q>a rare prodigy of crime and pollution.</q>&#8221; It is
                        true that a tragic circumstance arose out of his separation, over which I could have
                        wished, were it possible, to draw a veil; but as that may not be, and though by an
                        anachronism, as I shall have no further occasion to mention the first <persName

                        <persName key="ThDeQui1859">De Quincey</persName>, speaking of this dreadful event, says,
                            &#8220;<q>It is one chief misery of a beautiful young woman separated from her natural
                            protector, that her desolate situation attracts and stimulates the <pb xml:id="I.196"/>
                            calumnies of the malicious. Stung by these calumnies,</q>&#8221; he adds, &#8220;<q>and
                            oppressed, as I have understood, by the loneliness of her abode, she threw herself into
                            a pond and was drowned.</q>&#8221; Now it must be remembered that the separation took
                        place in the beginning of 1813, and that the catastrophe occurred nearly three years
                        afterwards,&#8212;a long period for her to have brooded over her wrongs or misfortunes
                        before they produced such frightful effects. Her fate was a dreadful misfortune to her who
                        perished, and him who survived. </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch10-17"> I have said in the &#8220;<name type="title"
                            key="ThMedwi1869.ShelleyPapers">Shelley Papers</name>,&#8221; that it is impossible to
                        acquit <persName key="PeShell1822">Shelley</persName> of all blame in this calamity. From
                        his knowledge of her character, he must have been aware, as has been said by another,
                            &#8220;<q>that she was an individual unadapted to an exposure to principles of action,
                            which if even pregnant with danger when of self-organisation, are doubly so when
                            communicated to minds altogether unfit for their reception;</q>&#8221; and he should
                        have kept an eye over her conduct. </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch10-18"> But I have since had reason, from undoubted authority, to change this
                        opinion. On their separation, he delivered her back into the hands of her <persName
                            key="JoWestb1835">father</persName> and <persName key="ElFarth1854">eldest
                            sister</persName>. He told them almost in these words, that &#8220;<q>his wife and
                            himself had never loved each other; that to continue to drag on the chain, would only
                            be a protraction of torture to both, and that as they could not legally extricate
                            themselves from the Gordian knot, they had mutually determined to cut it. That he
                            wished her all happiness, and should endeavour by sympathy with another, to seek it
                            himself. He added, that having received no fortune with her, and her father being in
                            easy circumstances, he was not at the moment able to make her the allowance he could
                            wish; that the sum he then gave her, was all he could command; that as the child was an
                            infant, he should for a time leave it in their hands, and care; but should at a more
                            advanced age, claim it; and they parted on good terms, though not without reproaches
                            and harsh language from the father.</q>&#8221; <pb xml:id="I.198"/> Little or no blame
                        as to the melancholy catastrophe that succeeded, could therefore be imputed to <persName
                            key="PeShell1822">Shelley</persName>; that must fall on her relations, who with the
                        knowledge of her character and conduct, by advice, or other measures, ought to have watched
                        over both. Having once confided her to their superintendence, he might consider, with many
                        others similarly circumstanced, that his responsibility was over. That he did not do so,
                        his compunction, which brought on a temporary derangement, proves. <persName
                            key="ThDeQui1859">De Quincey</persName>, in speaking of this circumstance, to which I
                        alluded in a memoir of <persName>Shelley</persName>, says that the mention of it arose from
                        a wish to gratify a fugitive curiosity in strangers; and adds, that it appears from the
                        peace of mind which <persName>Shelley</persName> is reported afterwards to have recovered
                        for a time, that he could not have had to reproach himself with any harshness or neglect as
                        contributing to the shocking catastrophe. Without any compunctious visitings, however,
                        morbidly sensitive as he was, well might it painfully excite him. Such <pb xml:id="I.199"/>
                        a fate as hers, could not be contemplated even by the most indifferent stranger, without a
                        deep sympathy; much more must the shock have come home to the feelings of one so intimately
                        connected with her. </p>

                        purpose, and who was every way qualified for the office; but <persName key="JoWestb1835"
                            >Mr. Westbrook</persName> refused to give them up, and instituted against

                        obtaining possession of them. The bill filed, and the answer to it, would, if they could be
                        procured, be most interesting. I imagine <persName>Shelley</persName> refers to the
                        document he put in, in a letter to some anonymous friend, who had, he thought, overrated
                        its merit, for he says,&#8212;&#8220;<q>It was a forced, unimpassioned piece of cramped and
                            cautious argument.</q>&#8221; But few authors are the best judges of their own
                        compositions, and the high idea which <persName>Shelley</persName> seems to have
                        entertained of his correspondent&#8217;s critical judgment, suggests that the arguments
                        were strong, and carried with them conviction. </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch11-2"> The petition presented to the court in the name of the infant plaintiffs,
                        states the marriage at Gretna Green, in the year 1811, and that they were the issue of it;
                        that the father had deserted his wife; that thereupon the mother returned to the house of
                        her father with the oldest of the infants, and that the other was soon after born; that
                        they had since that time been maintained by their mother, and her father; <pb
                            xml:id="I.201"/> and that the mother had lately died. It was then stated, that the
                        father, <hi rend="italic">since</hi> his marriage, had written and published a work, in
                        which he blasphemously denied the truth of the Christian religion, and denied the existence
                        of a God, the Creator of the universe; and that, since the death of his wife, he had
                        demanded that the children should be delivered up to him, and that he intended, if he could
                        get hold of their persons, to educate them as he thought proper. It goes on to say, that
                        their maternal grandfather had lately transmitted £2,000, four per cents., into the names
                        of trustees, upon trust for them, on their attaining twenty-one, or marriage with his
                        consent; and in the meantime to apply the dividends to their maintenance and education. </p>

                            activity, nevertheless in the probable range and extent of their operation, did not put
                            to hazard the happiness and welfare of those whose interests are involved upon such an
                            occasion as the present would be bound to attend to. This is a case, in which the
                            matter appears to me the father&#8217;s principles cannot be misunderstood; in which
                            his conduct, which I cannot but consider as highly immoral, has been established in
                            proof, and established as the effect of those principles; conduct, nevertheless, which
                            he represents to himself and to others, not as conduct to be considered as immoral, but
                            to be recommended and observed in practice, and as worthy of approbation. I consider
                            this, therefore, as a case in which the father has demonstrated that he must and does
                            deem it to be a matter of duty, which his principles impose on him, to recommend to
                            those whose opinions and habits he may take upon himself to form, <pb xml:id="I.205"/>

                        referred to the Master, to enquire what would be a proper place for the maintenance and
                        education of the infants, and also to enquire with whom, and under whose care the infants

                        proceedings were afterwards made an additional precedent in the case of <persName

                        since been declared by a Lord Chancellor, that such a power shall never again be exercised.
                        The argument of <persName>Mr. Long Wellesley</persName>, even on the admission of
                        irreligious or immoral conduct on the part of a father, was unanswerable. He contended that
                        it by no <pb xml:id="I.208"/> means follows&#8212;such is the innate love of virtue and
                        morality implanted in us, and a sense of the effects of a dereliction of them on their own
                        happiness and that of others&#8212;that the worst of men would wish to bring up his
                        children irreligiously, much less immorally. But with the exception of
                            <persName>Shelley&#8217;s</persName> separation from&#8212;called a desertion of, his
                        wife, and the writing and printing&#8212;for it was never published&#8212;of <name

                        against him; and, in confirmation of <persName key="LdByron">Byron&#8217;s</persName>
                        opinion, that he was one of the most moral men he ever knew, I can certainly say, that as
                        far as my experience of him goes, and it extended through his whole life, with the
                        exception only of a very few years, both in example and moral precept, in a high sense of
                        honour, and regard to truth, and all the qualities of a refined and perfect gentleman, no
                        one could have been a better guide and instructor of youth. </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch11-17"> What defence <persName key="PeShell1822">Shelley</persName> put in, we

                        from my <pb xml:id="I.209"/> knowledge of his character, I should consider that, however he
                        might have modified, and did modify his opinions, he was the last man to have recanted
                        them, either by compulsion, or in order to carry a point. The idea that the world would
                        have given him credit for making that recantation from interested motives, and not from
                        conviction, would alone have been sufficient to deter him from such a step. </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch11-21"> After their removal, he never saw them. They were become dead to him, and

                            <persName key="PeShell1822">Shelley</persName>; he loved them to idolatry, and clung to
                        them as part and parcel of himself. Sometimes a frightful dream came over him, that these
                        second pledges of affection would also be wrested from him by the same ruthless and
                        merciless <hi rend="italic">fiat</hi>, and the dread of such an event would have proved an

                            the heavens, that they look like those accumulated clouds of dazzling white, that

                            immensity staggers the imagination, and so far surpasses all conception, that it
                            requires an effort of the understanding to believe that they indeed form a part of the
                            earth.</q>&#8221; </p>

                            >Shelley</persName> in pecuniary matters, he found that on his arrival at Neufchatel,
                        his money was exhausted, and after obtaining thirty-eight pounds on the discount of a bill
                        for forty pounds, at three months, (pretty good interest,) they journeyed on to Lucerne. On
                        reaching the lake of Uri, they hired a boat. This romantic lake, remarkable for its deep
                        seclusion and sacred solitude, is thus described: &#8220;<q>The lake of Lucerne is
                            encompassed on all sides by high mountains, that rise abruptly from the water.
                            Sometimes their base points downwards perpendicularly, and casts a black shadow on the
                            waves,&#8212;sometimes they are covered with thick wood, whose dark foliage is
                            interspersed by the brown, bare crags, on which the trees have taken root. In every
                            part where <pb xml:id="I.216"/> a glade shows itself in the forest, it appears
                            cultivated, and cottages peep from among the woods. The most luxuriant islands, rocky
                            and covered with moss, and bending trees, are sprinkled over the lake. Most of these
                            are decorated by the figure of a saint, in wretched waxwork.</q>&#8221; </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch12-6"> After much search after a habitation, they at length domiciled themselves
                        in two unfurnished rooms, in an ugly big house at Brunen, called the Chateau. These they
                        hired at a guinea a month, had beds moved into them, and the next day took possession. It
                        was a wretched place, with no comfort or convenience. It was with some difficulty that they
                        could get any food prepared. As it was cold and rainy, they ordered a fire. They lighted an
                        immense stove, which occupied a corner of the room, and when heated, they were obliged to
                        throw open the windows, to prevent a kind of suffocation; added to this, there was but one
                        person in Brunen who could speak French, a barbarous sort of German being the language of
                        this part of Switzerland. It was <pb xml:id="I.217"/> with some difficulty, therefore, that
                        they could get their ordinary wants supplied. <persName key="PeShell1822"
                            >Shelley&#8217;s</persName> amusement, meanwhile, was writing. </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch12-7"> He commenced a romance on the subject of <name type="title"
                            key="PeShell1822.Assassins">the Assassins</name>. The fragment will be found in his
                            <name type="title" key="PeShell1822.Essays">Prose Works</name>, and evinces much power,
                        being a wonderful improvement on his former attempts of the kind. He drew his inspiration
                        from the scenes that were before his eyes. &#8220;<q>Nature undisturbed,</q>&#8221; he
                        says, &#8220;<q>had become an enchantress in these solitudes. She had collected here all
                            that was divine and wonderful from the armoury of her own omnipotence. The very winds
                            breathed health and renovation, and the joyousness of youthful courage. Fountains of
                            chrystalline water played perpetually among the aromatic flowers, and mingled a
                            freshness with their odour. The pine boughs became instruments of exquisite
                            contrivance, among which the ever varying breeze waked music of new and more delightful
                            melody. Such scenes of chaotic confusion and harrowing sublimity, surrounding and
                            shutting <pb xml:id="I.218"/> in the vale, added to the delights of its secure and
                            voluptuous tranquillity. No spectator could have refused to believe that some spirit of
                            great intelligence and power had hallowed these wilds to a deep and solemn
                        mystery.</q>&#8221; He adds, that &#8220;<q>the immediate effect of such a scene suddenly
                            presented to the contemplation of mortal eyes, is seldom the subject of authentic
                            record.</q>&#8221; </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch12-8"> I have thought that the following passage bears some allusion to himself.
                            &#8220;<q>An Assassin, accidentally the inhabitant of a civilized country, would wage
                            unremitting war from principle against the predilections and distastes of the many. He
                            would find himself compelled to adopt means which they would abhor, for the sake of an
                            object which they could not conceive that he should propose to himself. Secure and
                            self-enshrined in the magnificence and preeminence of his conceptions, spotless as the
                            light of heaven, he would be the victim among men, of calumny and persecution.
                            Incapable of distinguishing his motives, they would rank him among the vilest and most
                                atro-<pb xml:id="I.219"/>cious criminals. Great beyond all comparison with them,
                            they would despise him in the presumption of their ignorance. Because his spirit burned
                            with an unquenchable passion for their welfare, they would lead him, like his
                            illustrious master, amidst scoffs and mockings and insults, to the remuneration of an
                            ignominious death.</q>&#8221; </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch12-10"> It had been the intention of the party to cross the St. Gothard, at the
                        foot of which they were, and make an excursion into the north of Italy, but the idea was
                        soon abandoned. They resolved to return to England, from which they were distant eight
                        hundred miles. Was it possible, <pb xml:id="I.220"/> with twenty-eight pounds? enquires the
                        tourist;&#8212;but there was no alternative&#8212;the attempt must be made. They departed
                        from Lucerne in the <foreign><hi rend="italic">coche d&#8217;eau</hi></foreign> for
                        Loffenburg, a town on the Rhine, where the falls of that river prevented the same vessel
                        from proceeding any further. There they engaged a small canoe to convey them to Mumph.
                            &#8220;<q>It was long, narrow, and flat-bottomed, consisting mostly of deal boards,
                            unpainted, and nailed together with so little care, that the water constantly poured in
                            at the crevices, and the boat perpetually required emptying. The river was rapid and
                            sped swiftly, breaking as it passed on innumerable rocks just covered with water. It
                            was a sight of some dread to see the frail boat winding among the eddies of the rocks,
                            which it was death to touch, and where the slightest inclination on one side would
                            inevitably have upset it.</q>&#8221; </p>

                        where, taking their passage <pb xml:id="I.221"/> in another boat, laden with merchandise,
                        they bade adieu to Switzerland. </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch12-12"> &#8220;<q>We were carried down,</q>&#8221; says the tourist, &#8220;<q>by
                            a dangerously rapid current, and saw on each side, hills covered with vines and trees,
                            craggy cliffs, crowned by desolate towers and wooded islands, whose picturesque ruins
                            peeped from between the foliage, and cast the shadows of their forms on the troubled
                            waters without defacing them.</q>&#8221; </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch12-13"> Having reached Rotterdam, they embarked for England, and encountering
                        another storm on the bar, where they were for some time aground, landed in London, on the

                    <p xml:id="ch12-14"> I have heard <persName key="PeShell1822">Shelley</persName> frequently
                        dilate with rapture on the descent of the Rheuss and the Rhine. The remembrance of both,
                        never faded from his memory, and furnished additional stores to his poetic mind, to be
                        treasured up for after days, and reproduced in forms of surpassing sublimity and
                        loveliness. </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch12-15"> Yet though his imagination had been en-<pb xml:id="I.222"/>chanted by the
                        aspect of Nature in all her wonders, his bodily health was rather deteriorated than
                        improved by the fatigues of this painful journey; the first part of it performed on foot
                        beneath the burning suns, and through the arid plains and dusty roads of France; and the
                        latter under exposure to the chill blasts of the snowy Alps, and the cold air of open
                        boats. Money difficulties, the worst of all the evils of this life, had also contributed to
                        blunt in a great degree the charm; for the harass of ways and means lies like a weight of
                        lead on the spirit, and palsies enjoyment. He had spent during the six weeks, sixty pounds,
                        and was obliged even to go on credit at Rotterdam for his passage money, in order to be
                        enabled to set foot on his native shores. </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch12-16"> When arrived there, he had to look forward to four months before he could
                        hope to receive a single pound note of his anticipated allowance. His father&#8217;s heart
                        was steeled in obduracy, and with that hatred between fathers and sons which <pb
                            xml:id="I.223"/> seems hereditary in the family, <persName key="TiShell1844">Sir

                    <p xml:id="ch12-17"> The estate, as it was supposed, was strictly entailed; consequently his
                        coming into the property depended on his surviving his father. His own life was not
                        insurable, and was in so precarious a state that he had no possibility of raising money on
                        his contingency. He was now destined, therefore, to suffer all the horrors of destitution.

                    <p xml:id="ch13-3"> It has been said of a great German author, I believe <persName
                            key="JoHerde1803">Herder</persName>, that he had but one thought, and that was the
                        Universe. May it not be observed of <persName key="PeShell1822">Shelley</persName>, that he
                        had but one thought, and that was Love&#8212;Love in its most comprehensive
                        sense,&#8212;Love, the sole law that should govern the moral world, as it does the
                        universe. Love was his very essence. He worshipped Love. He saw personified in all things
                        animate and inanimate, the love that was his being and his bane. He, under the idealism of
                        the spirit of Solitude, in <name type="title" key="PeShell1822.Alastor">Alastor</name>,
                        paints his longing after the discovery of his antetype, the meeting with an understanding
                        capable of clearly estimating the deductions of his own; an imagination which could enter
                        upon, and seize the subtle and delicate peculiarities which he had delighted to cherish and
                        unfold in secret; with a frame, whose <pb xml:id="I.230"/> nerves, like the chords of two
                        exquisite lyres, strung to the accompaniment of one delightful voice, should vibrate with
                        the vibration of his own, and a combination of all these in such proportion as the type
                        within demands. He thirsted after his likeness&#8212;and he found it not,&#8212;no bosom
                        that could dive into the fountains of his soul&#8217;s deep stores, hold intercourse or
                        communion with his soul; the language of all in whom he had expected to meet with these
                        qualities, seemed as of a distant and a savage land,&#8212;unintelligible sounds, that
                        could make no music to his ear, could awaken no chord of music in his thoughts; when he
                        spoke, words of mute and motionless ice replied to words quivering and burning with the
                        heart&#8217;s best food. It was with this feeling of despair and disappointment, that he
                        sought in Nature what it had been a vain and fruitless hope to discover among his kind. Yet
                        in Nature, in the solitude of Nature,&#8212;in the trees, the flowers, the grass, the
                        waters and the sky, in every motion of the green leaves of <pb xml:id="I.231"/> spring,
                        there was heard, inaudible to others, a voice that gave back the echo of his own;
                        insensible to others, there was felt a secret correspondence with his self. There was an

                            incommunicably <pb xml:id="I.235"/> strange. It is the outpouring of his own emotions
                            embodied in the purest form he could conceive, painted in the ideal hues which his
                            brilliant imagination inspired, and softened by the anticipation of a near and

                    <p xml:id="ch13-6"> Early in the spring of 1816, in company with the two ladies who had been
                        sharers in the joys and sorrows of his former wanderings on the continent, he again took
                        leave of the white cliffs of Albion, and passing through Paris, where he made no stay,
                        followed the same line of country they had traversed nearly two years before, as far as
                        Troyes. There they left the route leading to Neufchatel, and by that which led through
                        Dijon and Dole, arrived at Poligny, and after resting at Champagnolles, a little village
                        situate in the depth of the mountains, entered Switzerland for the second time, by the pass
                        of <hi rend="italic">Les Rousses</hi>. Such was the state of the road then, that it
                        required the aid of ten men to support the carriage in its descent. </p>

                        from Paris to the Jura, knows not the delight with which the traveller looks upon the
                        glorious landscape that lies below him, diversified as it is by the crescent of Lake Leman,
                        its viney shores and cheerful towns, and framed in by the gigantic outline of the Alps,
                        surmounted by the domes and pinnacles of their eternal snows? We may imagine, then, the
                        transport with which <persName key="PeShell1822">Shelley</persName> hailed the approach of
                        Geneva. The party took up their quarters at Dejean&#8217;s, Secheron, then the best hotel,
                        though since eclipsed by the Bourg and so many others in that key to Italy, and yet in
                        position equalled by none, for it lies immediately under the eye of Mont Blanc.
                            &#8220;<q>From the meadows,</q>&#8221; says <persName>Shelley</persName>, &#8220;<q>we
                            see the lovely lake blue as the heavens which it reflects, and sparkling with golden
                            beams. The opposite shore is sloping and covered with vines. Gentlemen&#8217;s seats
                            are scattered over these banks, behind which rise <pb xml:id="I.237"/> ridges of black
                            mountains, and towering far above in the midst of the snowy Alps, the highest and queen
                            of all. Such is the view reflected by the Lake. It is a bright summer scene, without
                            any of that sacred solitude and deep seclusion that delighted us at Lucerne.</q>&#8221; </p>

                            key="JoPolid1821">Polidori</persName>, was already arrived. The two poets had never
                        met, but were not altogether strangers, for <persName key="PeShell1822">Shelley</persName>
                        had sent the author of <name type="title" key="LdByron.Harold">Childe Harold</name> a copy
                        of <name type="title" key="PeShell1822.Mab">Queen Mab</name> in 1812, soon after its

                        <persName key="PeShell1822">Shelley</persName>, soon after his arrival, wrote a note to the
                        noble lord, detailing at some length the accusations which had been laid against his
                        character, and adding, that if <persName key="LdByron">Lord Byron</persName> thought those
                        charges were not true, it would make him happy to have the honour of paying him a visit.
                        The answer was such as might be anticipated. There <pb xml:id="I.238"/> was, in their
                        present meeting at Geneva, no want of disposition towards a friendly acquaintance on both
                        sides. </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch13-10"> After a fortnight&#8217;s residence at Dejean&#8217;s, <persName
                            key="PeShell1822">Shelley</persName> and his female friends removed to the Campagne
                        Mont Allegre, on the opposite side of the lake; and shortly after, <persName key="LdByron"
                            >Lord Byron</persName> took that of Diodati. This villa had probably been chosen from
                        its association, for the <persName key="ChDioda1638">Diodati</persName> from whom it
                        derived its name, was a friend of <persName key="JoMilto1674">Milton</persName>; and the
                        author of <name type="title" key="JoMilto1674.Paradise">Paradise Lost</name> had himself,
                        in his way to and from Italy, hallowed it by his abode. The Campagne Mont Allegre, or
                        Chapuis, as it was sometimes called, lay immediately at the foot of Diodati, being only
                        separated from it by a vineyard, and having no other communication but a very tortuous,
                        hedged in, and narrow lane, scarcely admitting of a <foreign><hi rend="italic"
                                >char-a-banc</hi></foreign>. The spot was one of the most sequestered on the lake,
                        and almost hidden by a grove of umbrageous forest trees, as is a bird&#8217;s nest among
                        leaves, and invisible from the main road. At the <pb xml:id="I.239"/> extremity of the
                        terrace, is a secure little port, belonging to the larger villa, and here was moored the
                        boat which formed so much the mutual delight and recreation of the two poets. It was keeled
                        and clinker-built, the only one of the kind on the lake; and which, although <persName
                            key="ThMoore1852">Mr. Moore</persName> says it &#8220;<q>was fitted to stand the usual
                            squalls of the climate,</q>&#8221; was to my mind ill-adapted for the navigation, for
                        it drew too much water and was narrow and crank. I saw it two years after lying a wreck,
                        and half submerged, though (like <persName key="FrVolta1778">Voltaire&#8217;s</persName>
                        pen, of which hundreds have been sold as original to Englishmen at Ferney) there was at
                        that time a chaloupe at Geneva that went by the name of <persName>Byron&#8217;s</persName>.
                        The real boat was the joint property of the two poets, and in this frail vessel,
                            <persName>Shelley</persName> used to brave at all hours, <foreign><hi rend="italic"

                        These north-easters are terrific; they follow the course of the lake, and increasing in
                        violence as they drive along in blackening gusts, spread themselves at last on the devoted
                        town to which they are <pb xml:id="I.240"/> real pestilences. <persName>Maurice</persName>,
                        their Batellier, although a Westminster reviewer denies that they had one, speaking of
                            <persName>Shelley</persName>, said that &#8220;<q>he was in the habit of lying down at
                            the bottom of the vessel, and gazing at Heaven, where he would never enter.</q>&#8221;
                        I should not have given credit to a Genevese for so much poetry.
                        <persName>Byron</persName>, <persName>Moore</persName> says, &#8220;<q>would often lean
                            abstracted over the side, and surrender himself up in silence to the absorbing task of
                            moulding his thronging thoughts into shape.</q>&#8221; </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch13-11"> Of these water excursions, <persName key="PeShell1822">Shelley</persName>
                        used often to speak. To watch the sunset&#8212;to see it long after it sunk beneath the
                        horizon of the Jura, glowing in roses on the palaces of snow&#8212;to gaze on their
                        portraiture in the blue mirror, till they assumed the paleness of death, and left a
                        melancholy like we feel in parting, though with a certainty of meeting again, with some
                        object of our idolatry&#8212;these were some of his delights. The thunder-storms too, that
                        visited them, were grand and terrific in the extreme. &#8220;<q>We watch them,</q>&#8221;
                            <pb xml:id="I.241"/> says <persName key="MaShell1851">Mrs. Shelley</persName>,
                            &#8220;<q>as they approach from the opposite side of the lake, observing the lightning
                            play among the clouds in various parts of the heavens, and dart in jagged fissures upon
                            the piney heights of Jura, dark with the shadow of the overhanging cloud, whilst
                            perhaps the sun is shining cheerily on us.</q>&#8221; &#8220;<q>One night,</q>&#8221;
                            <persName>Shelley</persName> adds, &#8220;<q>we enjoyed a finer storm than I had ever
                            before beheld. The lake was lit up; the pines in Jura made visible, and all the scene
                            illuminated for an instant, when a pitchy blackness succeeded, and the thunder came in
                            frightful gusts over our heads amid the darkness.</q>&#8221; </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch13-12"> It was this very tempest, in all probability, that inspired <persName

                        the third canto of <name type="title" key="LdByron.Harold">Childe Harold</name>. </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch13-13"> The poets were not always singly, or but companioned by each other, in the
                        boat. Their water excursions were enlivened by the presence of the <pb xml:id="I.242"/>
                        ladies, and <persName key="JoPolid1821">Polidori</persName> sometimes made one of the

                            >Shelley</persName> and <persName key="LdByron">Byron</persName>, contributed to cement
                        this their friendship. Both were parted from their children. Both were marks for the
                        world&#8217;s obloquy; one was self-exiled for ever, the other soon about to be so. Their
                        pursuits were congenial, they had <q>

                            </lg>
                        </q> They both sought and found in solitude and nature a balm for their wounded spirits. No
                        wonder, then, that in this absolute retirement, they were so seldom apart. They spent their
                        mornings on the lake, their evenings in their own intellectual circle; and thus, as
                            <persName>Byron</persName> said, he passed that summer more rationally than at any
                        period of his life. That he profited by the superior reading and refined taste of
                            <persName>Shelley</persName>, is evident from all he wrote in Switzerland. He <pb

                        quotation, the shrewdness of the conjecture, the eloquence of the rhetoric, or the amiable

                    <p xml:id="ch13-21"> Whether this satire was calculated, or not, to injure <persName
                            key="JoPolid1821">Polidori&#8217;s</persName> prospects, is a question; but that it led
                        to the well-known result, which ended his career, is not probable. He made an attempt to
                        destroy himself at Diodati, and as <persName key="LdByron">Lord Byron</persName> said, was
                        always compounding poisons with a view of having at hand the most subtile and speedy means
                        of extinguishing life. Suicide seems with him to have been an <foreign><hi rend="italic"
                                >idée fixe</hi></foreign>. It is also said, that, like most Italians, he was very
                        susceptible of the tender passion; that he had fallen desperately and hopelessly in love.
                        The object of his passion was the beautiful and accomplished daughter of a catholic
                        gentleman of rank, and there was some romance in the story, for <pb xml:id="I.250"/> which,
                        however, I will not vouch. <persName>Polidori</persName> upset his gig at the entrance of
                        the Park, and broke his leg, and being unable to be removed further than the house,
                        remained there during his illness. This attachment was a preposterous one, and could but
                        lead to disappointment; but that it preyed upon his mind, and brought about the fatal
                        catastrophe, I cannot credit. He had an ill-regulated mind, which if properly directed,
                        might have rendered him a useful member of his profession, and society. Such was at least
                        the opinion of <persName>Lord Byron</persName>. <persName key="PeShell1822"
                            >Shelley</persName>, I have heard often speak of <persName>Polidori</persName>, but

                        exterior,&#8212;but in whose conversation there was nothing of the boy. He was surprised as

                            addition, the rudder was so broken as to render the management of it very difficult.

                        take hold of the public mind at once and for ever. It was an astonishing effort of genius

                            <persName key="LdByron">Byron</persName> said. I have heard it asserted that the idea
                        was <persName>Shelley&#8217;s</persName>, and that he assisted much in the development of
                        the plot; but there is no good ground for this supposition. The best proof of the contrary,
                        is his <name type="title" key="PeShell1822.OnFrankenstein">review</name> of the novel,
                        which no one who knew him would accuse him of having written, had he had any share in the
                        authorship; and as that admirable piece of criticism is not included, from modesty,
                        doubtless, on the part of <persName>Mrs. Shelley</persName>, among his Prose Works, I shall
                        give the greater part of it a place here. </p>

                            one of the most complete and original productions of the day. We debate with ourselves
                            in wonder, as we read it, what could have been the <pb xml:id="I.261"/> series of
                            thoughts, what could have been the peculiar experiences that awakened them,&#8212;which
                            conduced in the author&#8217;s mind, to the astonishing combinations of motives and
                            incidents, and the startling catastrophe, which compose this tale. There are, perhaps,
                            some points of subordinate importance, which prove that it is the author&#8217;s first
                            attempt. But in the judgment, which requires a very nice discrimination, we may be
                            mistaken; for it is conducted throughout with a firm and steady hand. The interest
                            gradually accumulates, and advances towards the conclusion, with the accelerated
                            rapidity of a rock rolled down a mountain. We are led breathless with suspense and
                            sympathy, and the heaping up of incident on incident, and the working of passion out of
                            passion. We cry &#8216;hold&#8212;hold, enough!&#8217; but yet there is something to

                    <p xml:id="ch14-13"> &#8220;<q>This novel rests its claim on being a source of powerful and
                            profound emotion. The elementary feelings of the human mind are exposed to view, and
                            those who are accustomed to reason deeply on their origin and tendency, will perhaps be
                            the only persons who can sympathise, to the full extent, in the interest of the actions
                            which are their result. But founded on nature as they are, there is perhaps no reader
                            who can endure any thing besides a mere love story, who will not feel a responsive
                            string touched in his inmost soul. The sentiments are so affectionate and innocent, the
                            characters of the subordinate agents in this strange drama are clothed in the light of
                            such a mild and gentle mind. The pictures of domestic manners are of the most simple
                            and attaching character; the father&#8217;s is irresistible and deep. Nor are the
                            crimes and malevolence <pb xml:id="I.263"/> of the simple Being, though indeed
                            withering and tremendous, the offspring of any unaccountable propensity to evil, but
                            flow irresistibily from certain causes fully adequate to their production. They are all
                            children as it were of Necessity and Human Nature. In this the direct moral of the book
                            consists, and it is perhaps the most important and the most universal application of
                            any moral that can be enforced by example. Treat a person ill, and he will become
                            wicked. Requite affection with scorn; let one being be selected, for whatsoever cause,
                            as the refuse of his kind,&#8212;divide him, a social being, from society, and you
                            impose upon him the irresistible obligations, malevolence and selfishness. It is thus
                            that too often in society, those who are best qualified to be its benefactors and its
                            ornaments, are branded by some accident with scorn, and changed by neglect and solitude
                            of heart into a scourge and a curse.</q>

                            the consequences of his being a social nature. He was an abortion and an anomaly, and

                            goodness was gradually turned into misanthropy and revenge. The scene between the Being

                            It is the sense of the existence of Love in its most extended and sublime capacity, and
                            of our participation in its good and its glory. It is the great principle of the
                            universe, which is the more condensed, but not less manifold; and of which, though

                        three months residence at Geneva, I cannot pass over in silence a circumstance that

                            >Mr. Moore</persName> says, a near relative&#8212;of <pb xml:id="I.281"/>
                        <persName key="MaShell1851">Mrs. Shelley</persName>. I remember her in 1820, living
                                <foreign><hi rend="italic">en pension</hi></foreign> at Florence, then twenty-six
                        or twenty-seven years of age. She might have been mistaken for an Italian, for she was a
                            <hi rend="italic">brunette</hi> with very dark hair and eyes. Her history was then a
                        profound secret, but as it has been told by <persName>Lord Byron&#8217;s</persName>
                        historian, may find a place here without any indiscretion on my part. As she possessed
                        considerable accomplishments&#8212;spoke French and Italian, particularly the latter, with
                        all its nuances and niceties&#8212;she was much courted by the Russian coterie, a numerous
                        and fashionable one in that city. Though not strictly handsome at that time, for she had
                        had much to struggle with, and mind makes its ravages in the fairest, most, she was
                        engaging and pleasing, and possessed an <foreign><hi rend="italic">esprit de
                            societé</hi></foreign> rare among our countrywomen. From her personal appearance at
                        that time, I should conceive, that when <persName>Byron</persName> formed an intimacy with
                        her at Geneva in 1816, she must have been strikingly handsome. It has been supposed that
                        his sonnet to <pb xml:id="I.282"/>
                        <persName>Genevra</persName> was intended for her; and though in some respects the portrait
                        is unlike, in drawing her, the noble poet might not perhaps wish to make it too faithful,
                        to be recognised. She was not altogether a stranger to <persName>Byron</persName> when they
                        met at Secheron; for, as he was about to quit London for the continent, in the spring of
                        that year, after his mysterious repudiation by <persName key="LyByron">Lady
                            Byron</persName>, she had an interview with him, for the purpose of obtaining an
                        engagement at Drury Lane, where I have no doubt she would have distinguished herself as an
                        actress; but which object, his recent resignation of office as chairman of the committee of
                        management, precluded him, as he explained to her, from forwarding. She had accompanied the
                            <persName>Shelleys</persName>, as may be already conjectured, on this their tour, and
                        passed the summer with them at Mont Allegre; and here it was that
                            <persName>Byron&#8217;s</persName> acquaintance with this lady was renewed. I do not
                        accuse him of any systematic seduction as regards <persName>Miss C.</persName> She was of a
                        fearless and independent character; despised the <pb xml:id="I.283"/> opinion of the world,
                        looking upon the law of marriage as of human invention, having been early imbued with the
                        doctrines of <persName key="MaWolls1797">Mary Wollstonecraft</persName>, and entertaining
                        high notions of the rights of women. The sex are fond of rakes: a strange infatuation! It
                        is said that <persName>Byron&#8217;s</persName> attentions were irresistible; and when they
                        were enhanced by verses, the very essence of <hi rend="italic">feeling</hi>,
                            <persName>Clara&#8217;s</persName> fall could not be doubtful. </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch15-14"> I have reason to believe, however, that this intrigue was carried on with
                        the greatest secrecy; and that neither the <persName>Shelleys</persName> nor <persName
                            key="JoPolid1821">Polidori</persName> were for a long time privy to it: perhaps also,
                        it arose out of some momentary frailty and impulse, from some fatal &#8220;importunity and
                        opportunity,&#8221; in which the senses rather than the heart were engaged&#8212;a
                        momentary intoxication, that the dictates of returning reason cooled into indifference on
                        both sides. </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch15-15"> The mystery, however, could not be kept&#8212;even if at the latter end of
                        August&#8212;they landed, I think, in England, on the 6th of September&#8212;it <pb

                        She gave birth in due time, to a daughter, who was called <persName key="AlByron1822"

                        consciousness of no wrong, as far as regarded this unfortunate connexion, he bore the
                        obloquy unflinchingly, rather than divulge what he had given his word to <persName

                            >Allegra</persName>, when a few months old, was carried by a Swiss nurse, and delivered

                            we were traversing the bare, squalid, ugly, corn-yielding country, that lies, if I
                            remember rightly, to the south-west. The hollow road ascended a hill, and near the
                            summit, <persName>Shelley</persName> observed a female child leaning against the bank
                            on the right. It was of a mean, dull, and unattractive aspect, and older than its
                            stunted growth denoted. The little girl was oppressed with cold, by hunger, and by a
                            vague feeling of abandonment. It was not easy to draw from her blue lips an intelligent
                            history of her condition. Love, however, is at once credulous and apprehensive, and
                                <persName>Shelley</persName> immediately decided that she had been deserted, and
                            with his wonted precipitation, (for in the career of humanity his active spirit knew no
                            pause) he proposed different schemes for the permanent relief of the poor foundling. I
                            answered, that it was desirable in the first place to try to procure some food, for of
                            this the want was manifestly the most urgent. I then climbed the hill to reconnoitre,
                            and ob-<pb xml:id="I.288"/>served a cottage close at hand, on the left of the road.
                            With considerable difficulty&#8212;with a gentle violence, indeed,
                                <persName>Shelley</persName> induced the child to accompany him thither. After much
                            delay, we procured from the people of the place some warm milk. It was a strange
                            spectacle to watch the young poet, with the enthusiastic and intensely earnest manner
                            that characterises the legitimate brethren of the celestial art&#8212;the heaven-born
                            and finely inspired sons of genuine poesy&#8212;holding the wooden bowl in one hand,
                            and the wooden spoon in the other, and kneeling on his left knee, that he might more
                            certainly attain to her mouth. The hot milk was agreeable to the girl, and its effects
                            were salutary, but she was obviously uneasy at the detention.</q>

                        shade by the qualities of her heart, took a great interest in the mother of <persName

                        obtained, a situation as humble companion. <persName key="ClClair1879">Miss C.</persName>
                        was too noble to conceal her story from the ear of her intended benefactress, before she
                        entered on her office; and in consequence of her sincerity, the affair was broken off. How
                        applicable are <persName key="PeShell1822">Shelley&#8217;s</persName> words to this
                        unfortunate lady, whose life before and since this one false step, has never had a shadow
                        of <pb xml:id="I.294"/> blame thrown on it, and whose talents, manners, and accomplishments
                        well fitted her for any circle. &#8220;<q>Has a woman obeyed the impulse of unerring
                            nature, the world declares against her, pitiless, unceasing war. She must be the tame

                            life of infamy&#8212;the low and bitter laugh of scorn scares her from all return. She
                            is the criminal, the froward, the untameable child; and society, forsooth, the pure and
                            virtuous matron, casts her as an abortion from her undefiled bosom.</q>&#8221; </p>

                        it is applied, let her reflect on these words, and blush through her rouge with shame. No!
                            &#8220;<q>the cold-hearted worldling</q>&#8221; will smile with self-complacency at her
                        own virtue, and deem it one of the proudest and most saving acts of her life, to have
                        repulsed and rejected the frail one. How would morality, dressed in stiff stays and <pb

                        ripened into the closest intimacy. It was indeed an epoch in his life. <persName>Leigh

                        been lost. <persName>Keats</persName> was left fatherless at an early age, and when he came
                        to years of discretion, was apprenticed to an apothecary, but the sight of suffering
                        humanity, and the anatomical school, soon disgusted him with the pursuit, and he abandoned
                        the profession of medicine, but not originally to follow the ill-named flowery paths of
                        poetry; for an authentic anecdote is told of him, corroborative of this remark. One day,
                        sitting dreamily over his desk, he was endeavouring to while away a tedious hour by copying
                        some verses from memory; one of his brother apprentices looking over his shoulder, said,
                                &#8220;<q><persName>Keats</persName>, what are you a poet?</q>&#8221; It is added,
                        he was much piqued at the <hi rend="italic">accusation</hi>, and replied, &#8220;<q>Poet
                            indeed! I never composed a line in my life.</q>&#8221; The same story is told of
                            <persName key="WaScott">Walter Scott</persName>, who in crossing over one of the Scotch
                        lakes, endeavoured to put his ideas into verse, but on landing had only made two bad
                        rhymes, and observed to <pb xml:id="I.297"/> the friend who accompanied him, &#8220;<q>I
                            shall never do for a poet.</q>&#8221; But <persName>Keats</persName>, no less than the
                        Wizard of the North, falsified his own prophecy. <persName>Keats</persName> was ever a
                        constant reader of <persName key="WiShake1616">Shakspeare</persName>, and I have before me
                        a folio edition of the great dramatist&#8217;s works, with notes and comments on <name
                            type="title" key="WiShake1616.Troilus">Troilus and Cressida</name>, and containing at
                        the end of the volume an ode, evidently a very early attempt, which, properly for his fame,
                        he did not publish. He might also have forborne giving to the world some other of the short
                        poems, his first attempts in the art. We are certainly indebted for the discovery of the
                        poetic vein in him to <persName>Leigh Hunt</persName>, and his encouragement of his young
                        friend. But it is equally owing to <persName>Leigh Hunt</persName> that the disciple
                        enrolled himself in what has been termed the Cockney school, and fell into a pale imitation
                        of the Elizabethan writers, and the adoption of a language, neither Shakspearean nor
                            <persName key="EdSpens1599">Spencerian</persName>&#8212;a language neither belonging to
                        his own time, nor to society. How well does <persName key="MaQuint">Quintilian</persName>

                            >Endymion</name>, an unreadable poem, only redeemed by the <name type="title">Hymn to

                            <persName>Keats</persName> had mutually agreed, in the same given time, (six months
                        each,) to write a long poem, and that the <name type="title">Endymion</name>, and <name

                        memoirs; and with this introduction of the reader to <persName>Keats</persName>, let me
                        turn to <persName>Shelley</persName>, and his eventful history. </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch16-4"> After living some time under <persName key="LeHunt">Leigh
                            Hunt&#8217;s</persName> roof, in the spring of 1817, <persName key="PeShell1822"
                            >Shelley</persName> took a house at Marlow, and there passed nearly a year. His choice
                        of Buckinghamshire, and of this town, as an abode, was chiefly owing to its being at an
                        easy distance from London, and on the banks of his favorite river the Thames. Here it was,
                        that in addition to <name type="title" key="PeShell1822.PrAthanase">Prince Athanase</name>,
                        some minor lyrics, and part of <name type="title" key="PeShell1822.Rosalind">Rosalind and
                            Helen</name>, he composed &#8220;<name type="title" key="PeShell1822.Revolt">The Revolt
                            of Islam</name>,&#8221; and wrote a pamphlet, now lost, on the occasion of the

                            &#8220;<name type="title">The Hermit of Marlow</name>.&#8221; In the spring of 1835, I
                        made an excursion to Marlow, in order to visit scenes, that were among the sources of
                        inspiration of <name type="title">Laon and Cythna</name>, as the first edition of <name
                            type="title">The Revolt of Islam</name> was entitled. The house he inhabited was
                        pointed out to me, by almost the first person, a middle-aged man, of whom I enquired. It
                        was in a retired street, and commanded no view&#8212;a comfortable abode, with gothic
                        windows, and behind it a garden and shady <pb xml:id="I.300"/> orchard plot, of some
                        extent, carpeted with the greenest turf, which must have afforded a delightful retreat in
                        the summer noon. Not only the town itself, with its church and bridge, and old buildings,
                        is highly picturesque, but the environs are strikingly beautiful, and remarkable for their
                        fine country seats; Daney, so called from a Danish camp having once existed here, whose
                        entrenchment may still be traced,&#8212;Hanneker, built by <persName key="InJones1652"
                            >Inigo Jones</persName>, and many other noble residences, inhabited by families of
                        wealth and distinction, diversify the landscapes, and make them an enchantment. Nor must I
                        forget the fall of the river, over an artificial embankment immediately above the town,
                        where the eye crossing the richest meadows, rests on the lovely beech groves of Bisham
                        Abbey. &#8220;<q>In no place are riches and poverty presented in more prominent contrast.
                            Lace-making is the occupation of the poor, women being the operatives, who lose their
                            health by sedentary labour, for which they are badly paid. The poor-laws ground to the
                            dust <pb xml:id="I.301"/> those who had just risen above pauperage, and were obliged to
                            pay them. The changes produced by peace following a long war, were heavily felt; the
                            trade which had been their support, flowing into other channels, produced great
                            destitution and misery, which a bad harvest contributed to enhance.</q>&#8221;
                            <persName>Shelley</persName> had a very early sympathy for the working classes. I
                        remember the very harrowing effect which <persName key="RoSouth1843"

                        frightful, faithful pictures ever drawn of the wretchedness, vice, and immorality that seem
                        necessary concomitants of an overproduction of manufactures. The impression this feelingly
                        written work made on <persName>Shelley</persName>, was ineffaceable, and gave rise to the

                        that his name is still perpetuated among the inhabitants, who are proud of having harboured
                        the poet, and counted him among their number. I was surprised indeed, considering the low

                        with his works, and hailed the circumstance as a pledge of his immortality,&#8212;and an

                            >Spencer</persName>, which he wields as none have ever done before him. The fragment of

                        pistol practice, and it was complained that he &#8220;<q>frightened the place from its

                        table. She told me it was her favourite poem, and that she read it several times every

                        perhaps the mental excitement gave a diversion to his thoughts, and it must have required a

                        irreparable, weighing more than all the rest&#8212;induced him to come to a resolution of

                        of his excursion to Como, in a letter to his friend <persName key="ThPeaco1866">Mr.
                            Peacock</persName>. &#8220;<q>Since I last wrote to you, we have been at Como, looking
                            for a house. This lake exceeds any thing I ever beheld of beauty, with the exception of
                            the arbutus-islands of Killarney. It is long and narrow, and has the appearance of a
                            mighty river winding among the mountains and the forests. We sailed from the town of
                            Como to a tract of country called the Tremezina, and saw the various aspects presented
                            by that part of the lake. The mountains between Como and that village, are covered with
                            chesnut forests, which sometimes descend to the very verge of the lake, overhanging it
                            with their hoary branches. But usually the immediate border of the shore is composed of
                            laurel trees, and bay and <pb xml:id="I.311"/> myrtle, and wild fig-trees, and olives,
                            which grow in the crevices of rocks, and overhang the caverns, and shadow the deep
                            glens, which are filled with the flashing light of the waterfalls.</q>&#8221; </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch17-2"> I have been thus minute in the description of this lake, because he here
                        lays the scene of <name type="title" key="PeShell1822.Rosalind">Rosalind and Helen</name>.
                        I was mistaken in supposing he had past the summer at Como; in fact his stay there was
                        confined to two days, for he found the villas far too expensive for him. </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch17-3"> Regrets that so few of <persName key="PeShell1822"
                            >Shelley&#8217;s</persName> letters should have been saved, will be awakened by the
                        perusal of those which during his first visit to Italy he addressed to <persName
                            key="ThPeaco1866">Mr. Peacock</persName>. These letters are very valuable, nor do more
                        splendid specimens of writing exist in any language. It is true that (as confessed by
                            <persName key="MaShell1851">Mrs. Shelley</persName>) his early impressions regarding
                        the Italians were formed in ignorance and precipitation, and became altogether altered
                        after a longer stay in the country; and that his knowledge of painting, though he exhibits
                        a high feeling of art, was a very limited <pb xml:id="I.312"/> one; and his criticisms on
                        the works of particular masters, shew but a very superficial acquaintance with the subject.
                        He used to say that he understood statuary, and there he was right&#8212;but not painting;
                        not meaning that he was in any way insensible to the merits of pictures&#8212;of the divine
                            <persName key="RaSanzi1520">Raphael&#8217;s</persName>, for instance, whom I have often
                        thought <persName>Shelley</persName> resembled in expression, (I allude to the portrait in
                        the Louvre) as well as genius, though it took a different direction,&#8212;but that he did
                        not know the styles of different masters&#8212;a knowledge which is only to be acquired by
                        a retentive memory, and the faculty of comparison. Of his appreciation of the ancient
                        sculptures, I shall have to speak hereafter,&#8212;there he was at home. </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch17-4"> After sojourning at Milan for nearly a month, during which he appears to
                        have received but one letter from England, on the 1st May he proceeded towards Pisa. He was
                        much struck with the well irrigated, rich plain of the <hi rend="italic">Milanese</hi>, and
                        the sight of the vineyards about Parma revived <pb xml:id="I.313"/> all his classical
                        recollections&#8212;his memories of the <name type="title" key="PuVirgi.Georgics"
                            >Georgics</name>. &#8220;<q>The vines,</q>&#8221; he says, &#8220;<q>here, are
                            particularly picturesque. They are trelissed on immense stakes, and the trunks of them
                            are moss-grown and hoary with age. Unlike the French vines, which creep lowly along the
                            ground, they form rows of intertwined bowers, which when the leaves are green, and the
                            red grapes hanging among their branches, will afford a delightful shadow to those who
                            sit upon the moss beneath.</q>&#8221; </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch17-5"> From Pisa he proceeded to Leghorn, where he staid a month. There he made
                        acquaintance with Mr. and <persName key="MaGisbo1836">Mrs. Gisborne</persName>, the latter
                        of whom, he says, was very amiable and accomplished, and by the former of whom he was
                        initiated in the beauties of <persName key="PeCalde1681">Calderon</persName>, and purchased
                        some odd volumes of his plays, and Autos, which were ever after his constant companions. He
                        now retreated from the summer heats to the baths of Lucca, posted in umbrageous chesnut
                        forests. He did not there <pb xml:id="I.314"/> forget to visit the <foreign><hi
                                rend="italic">Prato fiorito</hi></foreign>, a spot on the mountain, carpeted with
                        jonquils, from which the place takes the name of the Meadow of Flowers. So powerful is
                        their odour, that many persons have fainted with their excess of sweetness, and <persName
                            key="PeShell1822">Shelley</persName> has described to me, that they were nearly
                        producing on him the same effect. </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch17-6"> Some time in August, leaving his family at the baths, he set out for
                        Florence. The view from the Boboli gardens, in a note which he shewed me&#8212;a view
                        almost unparalleled&#8212;inspired him with the following burst of poetry: &#8220;<q>You
                            see below Florence, a smokeless city, with its domes and spires occupying the vale, and
                            beyond to the right, the Apennines, whose base extends even to the walls. The green
                            valleys of the mountains which gently unfold themselves upon the plains, and the
                            intervening hills, covered with vineyards and olive plantations, are occupied by the
                            villas, which are, as it were, another city&#8212;a Babylon of palaces and gardens. In
                            the midst of the picture rolls the Arno, through woods, and <pb xml:id="I.315"/>
                            bounded by the aerial snowy heights of the Apennines. On the right a magnificent
                            buttress of craggy hills, overgrown with wilderness, juts out in many shapes over a
                            lovely valley, and approaches the walls of the city. Cascini and other villages occupy
                            the pinnacles and abutments of those hills, over which are seen at intervals the aerial
                            mountains, hoary with snow, and intersected with clouds. The valley below is covered
                            with cypress groves, whose obeliskine forms of intense green, pierce the grey shadow of
                            the wintry hill that overlooks them. The cypresses too of the garden form a magnificent
                            foreground of accumulated verdure, pyramids of dark green rising out of a mass, between
                            which are cut, like caverns, recesses, conducting into walks.</q>&#8221; </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch17-7"> His present visit to Florence was a short one. He was anxious to reach
                        Venice. There he found <persName key="LdByron">Lord Byron</persName> domiciliated. <name
                            type="title" key="PeShell1822.Julian">Julian and Madalo</name>, which he calls a

                        and the sketch of him in the preface is highly valuable. <persName key="PeShell1822"
                            >Shelley</persName> says, that without mixing much in the society of his countrymen, he
                        resides chiefly in his magnificent palace in that city. &#8220;<q>He is,</q>&#8221; he
                        adds, &#8220;<q>a person of most consummate genius, and capable, if he would direct his
                            energies to such an end, of becoming the redeemer of his degraded country.</q>&#8221;
                        In his sketch, he does not spare his friend, and winds it up

                            but it is on his own hopes and affections only that he seems to trample, for in social
                            life no person can be more gentle, patient, and unassuming. He is cheerful, frank, and
                            witty.</q>&#8221; </p>

                            prostitute of the night, and his convivial joys were pushed to all the extravagance of
                            frantic Bacchanals. His passions injured both his understanding and

                        happiness. The contrast of its former greatness with its present state of degradation and
                        decay&#8212;its once proud independence, when it gave laws to the Mediterranean, <pb

                        their temporary abode. &#8220;<q>I Capuccini, which takes its name from a Capuchin convent
                            suppressed by the French, is picturesquely situate. The house is overhung by the
                            ancient castle of Este, the habitation of owls and bats, but formerly the residence of
                            the Medici family, before they migrated to Florence. From the garden they looked over
                            the wide flat plains of Lombardy, in which they saw the sun and moon rise and set, and
                            all the golden magnificence of autumnal clouds, pleasures which they enjoyed the more
                            after the contrast of the secluded chesnut-overshadowing ravine of the <hi

                            <persName>Shelley</persName>, that is highly idiosyncratic of him, and marks that

                        in his character. Their infant girl was seized with one of those disorders prevalent in
                        that season from the heat, and there being no good medical advice nearer than Venice, <pb
                            xml:id="I.321"/> they hastened towards it with the child. His firmness and intrepidity
                        must have been indeed great, when they could so far overawe an Austrian guard, as to make
                        them disobey orders. He had no passport, but they allowed him to quit Fusina without one. </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch17-13"> The loss of this child&#8212;the first misfortune of that kind its parents
                        had to endure&#8212;hastened their journey towards Rome, after only a three weeks&#8217;

                            would startle the oppressor.</q>&#8221; Alas! he did not find it so himself. They went
                        afterwards to see the prison in the hospital of Santa Anna. &#8220;<q>The
                        dungeon,</q>&#8221; he says, &#8220;<q>is low and dark, and when I say it is really a very
                            decent dungeon, I speak of one who has seen those in the Doge&#8217;s palace <pb
                                xml:id="I.322"/> at Venice. But it is a horrible abode for the coarsest and meanest
                            thing that ever wore the shape of man, much more for one of delicate susceptibilities,
                            and elevated fancies. It is low, and has a grated window, and being sunk some feet
                            below the level of the earth, is full of unwholesome damps.</q>&#8221; </p>

                            hundred feet into a sightless gulph of snow-white vapour, which bursts up for ever and
                            for ever from a circle of black crags, and thence leaping downwards, makes five or six

                            exhibit, on a smaller scale, and with beautiful and sublime variety, the same

                    <p xml:id="ch18-1"> I shall now bring the travellers to Rome. </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch18-2"> In his first visit to the capitol of the world, after a hasty glance at its
                        ruins, he passed on to Naples, where he hoped to find in its mild climate, some alleviation
                        of his bodily sufferings, and in the scenery of its bay, a soothing balsam to the wounds of
                        his harassed and weary spirit. But this object was not to be attained. Nor did his
                        excursions to Venice prove a &#8220;medicine to <pb xml:id="I.324"/> his mind
                        diseased.&#8221; I have often heard him dilate with rapture on the beauty of that divine
                        Bay, as he hung over the side of the boat, and gazed on the subaqueous ruins of the wrecked
                        palaces overspread with marine flowering plants and weeds, that grow luxuriantly about
                        them. In speaking of these, he observed that they sympathise, like those on land, with the
                        change of the season. </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch18-3"> A singular circumstance occurred to <persName key="PeShell1822"
                            >Shelley</persName>, which, after his death, I talked over with <persName key="LdByron"
                            >Lord Byron</persName> at Pisa&#8212;for he was equally acquainted with the story, as
                        told to us mutually, and which he more than once made a subject of conversation with me. </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch18-4"> The night before his departure from London, in 1814, he received a visit
                        from a married lady, young, handsome, and of noble connections, and whose disappearance
                        from the world of fashion, in which she moved, may furnish to those curious in such
                        inquiries a clue to her identity. </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch18-5"> The force of love could not go further, when <pb xml:id="I.325"/> a person
                        so richly endowed, as he described her, could so far forget the delicacy of her sex, and
                        the regard due to the character of woman, as to make the following
                            confession:&#8212;&#8220;<q>I have long known you in your <name type="title"

                            heart that inspired it. In your uncompromising passion for liberty&#8212;your universal
                            and disinterested benevolence&#8212;your aspiring after the amelioration of the state
                            of mankind, and the happiness of your species, and more than all, in your sentiments
                            respecting the equality of conditions, and the unfettered union between the
                            sexes,&#8212;your virtues, removed from all selfish considerations, and a total
                            disregard of opinion, have made you in my eyes the <foreign><hi rend="italic">beau

                            with myself, to tell you that I have renounced my husband, my name, my family and
                            friends; and have resolved, after mature delibera-<pb xml:id="I.326"/>tion, to follow
                            you through the world, to attach my fortune, which is considerable, to yours, in spite
                            of all the obloquy that be cast on me.</q>&#8221; </p>

                        <persName key="PeShell1822">Shelley</persName> was at that moment, on the eve, as I have
                        said, of parting from England with one to whom he was devotedly attached;&#8212;none but a

                        surpassed him in the qualities of one,) could have succeeded in acting with a high-born and
                        high-bred woman, a becoming part in such an arduous scene. He could not but feel deep
                        gratitude&#8212;admiration without bounds, for that enthusiastic and noble-minded person;
                        who had not shrunk from a confession&#8212;a confession hard indeed for her to have
                        made&#8212;an avowal of a love that must have cost her so many struggles to have clothed in
                        words. </p>

                        endeavoured to infuse a balm into her wounded soul, to soothe her hurt pride,&#8212;I had

                        solely to physical causes, but which had a far <pb xml:id="I.330"/> deeper root.
                            &#8220;<q>Constant and poignant physical sufferings,</q>&#8221; she says,

                            often enjoyed our wanderings in the environs of Naples, and our excursions on its sunny
                            sea, yet many hours were passed when his thoughts, shadowed by illness, became gloomy,
                            and then he escaped to solitude, and in verses which <hi rend="italic">he hid from me,
                                from fear of wounding me</hi>, poured forth morbid, but too natural bursts of
                            discontent and sadness;</q>&#8221; and she adds, &#8220;<q><hi rend="italic">that it
                                was difficult to imagine that any melancholy he shewed, was aught but the effect of
                                the constant pain to which he was a martyr.</hi></q>&#8221; </p>

                            the ruins, and to have traced every narrow and ill-defined footpath that winds among

                            and a thousand nameless plants, sown by the wandering winds&#8212;an undecaying
                            investitute of Nature, to soften down their vast desolation.</q>&#8221; Here, he told

                            >Prometheus</persName>, was not conceived or executed till several months later, at
                        Florence. <persName key="MaShell1851">Mrs. Shelley</persName> has given so excellent <pb
                            xml:id="I.338"/> an analysis of this drama, that it would be vain for me to attempt it.
                            <persName key="PeShell1822">Shelley</persName> believed, with <persName

                        should be no evil, and would be none. That man could be so perfectionised as to be able to
                        expel evil from his own nature, and from the greater part of creation, was the cardinal
                        point of his system; and he had so conquered himself, and his own passions, that he was a
                        living testimony to the truth of his doctrine. Such he had depicted <persName

                            >Prometheus</name>, typifying a being full of fortitude and hope, and the spirit of
                        triumph, emanating from a reliance in the ultimate omnipotence of good. There was one point
                        on which I had several discussions with <persName>Shelley</persName>, his introduction of
                        the Furies into his sublime drama. These allegorical personages of the Greek mythology, I
                        contended ought to have had no place in his <name type="title">Prometheus</name>. Their
                            at-<pb xml:id="I.339"/>tributes were widely different from those which should have been
                        called into exercise. They properly formed a prominent feature in the machinery of tbe
                        Orestian story, and <persName>Schiller</persName> admirably introduces them in his

                        he had nothing to unsay or wish undone; all their tortures must have been ineffectual as
                        against the Firebearer, and well might Earth exclaim, when <persName type="fiction"

                        the words of that fragment. &#8220;<q>A figure only visible at Rome at night, or in
                            solitude, and then only to be seen amid the dilapidated temples of the Forum, or
                            gliding away through the weed-grown galleries of the Colyseum, crossed their path. His
                            face, though emaciated, displayed the elementary outline of exquisite grace. It was a
                            face once seen never to be forgotten. The mouth and the moulding of the chin resembled
                            the eager and impassioned tenderness of the statues of <persName type="fiction"
                                >Antinous</persName>, but instead of the effeminate sullenness of the eye, and the
                            narrow smoothness of the forehead, there was an expression of profound and piercing
                            thought. The brow was clear and open, and his eyes deep, like two wells of chrystal
                            water that reflect the all-beholding heavens. Over all was spread a timid expression of
                            diffidence and retirement, that contrasted strangely with the abstract and fearless
                            character which predominated in his form and <pb xml:id="I.342"/> gestures. He avoided,
                            in an extraordinary degree, what is called society, but was occasionally seen to
                            converse with some accomplished foreigner, whose appearance might attract him in his
                            solemn haunts. He spoke Italian with fluency, though with a peculiar but sweet
                            accent.</q>&#8221; </p>

                            gymnasia. The sculptors were not mere mechanicians&#8212;they were citizens and

                            what those to whom we more particularly allude, did not possess, great sweetness of
                            nature, and enthusiasm for good, and his style is as it ought to be, the offspring of
                            the high <pb xml:id="I.347"/> mixtures. It disproves the adage of the Latin poet.
                            Majesty and love do sit on one throne in the lofty buildings of his poetry, and they

                            that even from that period he carried about with him a soured and discontented

                        scattered far and wide. It worked well. The detractor knew what he was about. The moral <pb
                            xml:id="I.366"/> English public are apt to associate the man with his works; and the
                        consequence was, that this sublime poem, published at <persName>Shelley&#8217;s</persName>
                        own expense, fell almost still-born from the press. </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch20-17"> On the eve of my departure from Bombay, in October 1818, I met in the
                        bazaar, at a Parsee book-stall, with a copy of the <name type="title"
                            key="PeShell1822.Revolt">Revolt of Islam</name>. It had been shipped with other
                        unsaleable literary commodities&#8212;for it is the habit of the purchasers at the trade
                        sales, to send out such wares to the colonies,&#8212;and I purchased it for little more
                        than its value in waste paper, with which it was its fate to line many a trunk, and furnish
                        wrappers for the grocer. Young men on quitting school and college, lead a life of so much
                        adventure, are so much absorbed in the pursuits and occupations of active life, that they
                        know not till some circumstance brings back the past, how much regard they entertain for
                        each other. I had, it is true, heard of the result of his first unhappy marriage, but his
                        second union was new to me, and the Introduction, full of beauty and feeling, <pb
                            xml:id="I.367"/> and the allusions in it to his school life, reawakened my sympathies,
                        and revived all my dormant affections. But if I yearned to see him again, and anticipated
                        the period of our meeting once more with delight, I was astonished at the greatness of his
                        genius, and made the volume the companion of my journey, delighting to trace in it the
                        elements of his young mind down to their complete development, as in a chart we love to
                        follow the course of some river whose source we have visited. On my return he was the first
                        person I wrote to, and found that he had not forgotten the companion of his boyhood. His
                        letters breathed the same warmth of regard which he had ever entertained for me, and they
                        contained an invitation to visit him at Florence, where I at first addressed him, he having
                        quitted England little more than a year before I landed at Liverpool. How much do I regret
                        the loss of these letters! </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch20-18"> I will beg the reader to excuse this extraneous matter, and take up the

                        <pb xml:id="I.368"/> wanderings&#8212;returning to Florence, where he passed the autumn and
                        part of the winter of 1819. </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch20-19"> Florence the magnificent, with its fortressed palaces&#8212;its Piazza
                        Vecchia, crowded with statues, its Santa Croce, and Cascine and Gardens, and splendid
                        galleries, realized all <persName key="PeShell1822">Shelley&#8217;s</persName> dreams; and
                        here probably he would have taken up his permanent residence, but for the climate, which he
                        considered highly detrimental to his health. Those who know that city, will have
                        experienced the keen, dry, piercing winds, that sweep down from the Apennines,
                        interpenetrate, and pierce like a sword through the system, tearing every house to tatters.
                        They acted on <persName>Shelley&#8217;s</persName> sensitive frame most prejudicially. </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch20-20"> On the 25th of January, having completed a third act to his <name
                            type="title" key="PeShell1822.Prometheus">Prometheus</name>, and written his <name

                        embarked for Pisa,&#8212;a most original way of making <pb xml:id="I.369"/> the journey,
                        which by the tortuous Arno must have been very slow and tedious. His love of boating,
                        however, prevailed over considerations of comfort in travelling, and he thought that,
                        suffering as he was from his complaint, he could better bear the motion of a boat, than of
                        a carriage, and he anticipated, even at that season, &#8220;<q>the delights of the sky, the
                            river, and the mountains.</q>&#8221; </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch20-21"> His first impression of Pisa, as appears by one of his letters, was not
                        very favourable, but it being in a hollow, and sheltered from the Tramontana, he found so
                        great a relief, that he decided to make it hereafter his winter place of abode. Another
                        inducement was the water&#8212;the best in Italy, which is brought from the mountains by an
                        aqueduct, whose long line of arches reminded him of the Campagna. </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch20-22"> In the spring he stopped a week or two near Leghorn, with his friends the
                        <persName key="MaGisbo1836">Gisbornes</persName>, and it was on a beautiful evening,
                        while wandering among the lanes, where myrtle hedges were the <pb xml:id="I.370"/> bowers
                        of the fire-flies, that he heard the carolling of the skylark, which inspired one of his
                        most beautiful <name type="title" key="PeShell1822.OdeSkylark">poems</name>. </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch20-23"> They spent the summer at the baths of St. Julien, four miles from Pisa, at
                        the foot of the mountains, which <persName key="DaAligh">Dante</persName> says&#8212; <q>

                        any autobiographical matter that may creep into my narrative. </p>

                                    <hi rend="small-caps">My Dear Sir</hi>,&#8212;We are now in this lovely spot,
                                    where for a time we have fixed our residence. The rent of our cottage,
                                    furnished, is £1 10s. per week. We do not intend to take <pb xml:id="I.374"/>
                                    up our abode here for a perpetuity, but should wish to have a house in Sussex.
                                    Perhaps you would look out for us. Let it be in some picturesque, retired
                                    place&#8212;St. Leonard&#8217;s Forest, for instance. Let it not be nearer to
                                    London than Horsham, nor near any <hi rend="italic">populous</hi> manufacturing
                                    town. We do not covet either a propinquity to <hi rend="italic">barracks</hi>.
                                    Is there any possible method of raising money without exorbitant interest until
                                    my coming of age? I hear that you and my <persName key="TiShell1844"
                                        >father</persName> have had a rencontre. I was surprised that he dared to
                                    attack you, but men always hate those whom they have injured; this hatred was,
                                    I suppose, a stimulant which supplied the want of courage. <persName
                                        key="WiWhitt1832">Whitton</persName> has written to me to state the
                                    impropriety of my letter to my mother and sister; this letter I have returned,
                                    with a passing remark on the back of it. I find that affair on which those
                                    letters spoke is become the general gossip of the idle newsmongers of Horsham.
                                    They give me credit of having invented it. They do my invention much <pb
                                        xml:id="I.375"/> honour, but greatly discredit their own penetration. </p>

                                    mentioned the possibility, alluding at the same time to the imprudence, of
                                    raising money even at my present age, at seven per cent. <hi rend="italic">We
                                        are now so poor as to be actually in danger of every day being deprived of
                                        the necessaries of life</hi>. In two <pb xml:id="I.376"/> years, you hinted
                                    that I could obtain money at legal interest. My poverty, and not my will
                                    consents (as <persName type="fiction">Romeo&#8217;s</persName> apothecary
                                    says), when I request you to tell me the readiest method of obtaining this. I
                                    could repay the principal and interest, on my coming of age, with very little
                                    detriment to my ultimate expectations. In case you see obvious methods of
                                    effecting this, I would thank you to remit me a small sum for immediate
                                    expenses; if not, on no account do so, as some degree of hazard must attend all
                                    my acts, under age, and I am resolved never again to expose you to suffer for
                                    my imprudence. <persName key="JoWestb1835">Mr. Westbrook</persName> has sent me
                                    a small sum, with an intimation, that we are to expect no more; this suffices
                                    for the immediate discharge of a few debts; and it is nearly with our very last
                                    guinea, that we visit the <persName key="DuNorfo11">Duke of N.</persName>, at

                                    from this visit. That reception into <persName>Abraham&#8217;s</persName> bosom
                                    appeared to me to be the consequence of some <pb xml:id="I.377"/> infamous
                                    concessions, which are, I suppose, synonymous with duty.&#8212;Love to all. </p>

                                    at length arrived at Nantgwillt, near <persName key="ThGrove1824">Mr. T.
                                        Groves</persName>. I could find no house throughout <pb xml:id="I.379"/>
                                    the north of Wales, and the merest chance Has conducted me to this spot.
                                        <persName>Mr. Hooper</persName>, the present proprietor, is a bankrupt, and
                                    his assignees are empowered to dispose of the lease, stock, and furniture,
                                    which I am anxious to purchase. They will all be taken at a valuation, and
                                        <persName>Mr. T. Grove</persName> has kindly promised to find a proper
                                    person to stand on my side. The assignees are willing to give me credit for
                                    eighteen months, or longer; but being a minor, my signature is invalid. Would
                                    you object to join your name in my bond, or rather, to pledge yourself for my
                                    standing by the agreement when I come of age? The sum is likely to be six or
                                    seven hundred pounds. </p>

                                <p xml:id="I.App.6-2"> The farm is about two hundred acres, one hundred and thirty
                                    acres arable, the rest wood and mountain. The house is a very good one, the
                                    rent ninety-eight pounds, which appears abundantly cheap. My dear sir, now pray
                                    answer me by return of post, as I am at present in an unpleasant state of
                                    suspense with regard to this <pb xml:id="I.380"/> affair, as so eligible an
                                    opportunity for settling in a cheap, retired, romantic spot will scarcely occur
                                    again. </p>

                                    community of disappointment, I shall do so now, without ceremony. </p>

                                    still consider your proposal of fixing the interview in London as the most
                                    eligible. </p>

                                    seeing you, the sooner my mind, and that of my wife, will be relieved from a
                                    most unpleasant feeling of embarrassment and uncertainty. You may entirely
                                    confide in my secrecy and prudence. </p>

                        have recognised him in a crowd. His figure was emaciated, and somewhat bent, owing to
                        near-sightedness, and his being forced to lean over his books, with his eyes almost
                        touching them; his hair, still profuse, and curling naturally, was partially interspersed

                        strikingly intellectual. There was also a freshness and purity in his complexion that he
                        never lost. I accompanied him to the baths, then, owing to the lateness of the season, (it
                        was November,) quite deserted,&#8212;for they are completely a summer resort; and there I

                            Shelley</persName>, and saw <persName key="PeShell1889">Percy</persName>, their little
                        son, then an <pb xml:id="II.3"/> infant. Their house was immediately on the banks of the
                        Serchio, and on the very day of my arrival, that little, rapid river, or rather the canal
                        that branches from it, overflowed its banks; no uncommon circumstance. It ran into the
                        square, and formed a flood that threatened to cut off the communication with the main road
                        to Pisa. <persName>Mrs. Shelley</persName> speaks of the event. Well do I remember the
                        scene, which I stood with <persName key="PeShell1822">Shelley</persName> at the window to
                        admire. The Contadine bore torches, and the groups of cattle, and the shouts of the
                        drivers, the picturesque dresses of their wives, half immersed in the water, and carrying
                        their children, and the dark mountains in the background, standing out in bold relief,
                        formed a singular spectacle, well worthy of a painter&#8217;s study.
                            <persName>Shelley</persName> wished me to sketch it, but it was far beyond my powers of
                        delineation,&#8212;besides that I had no colours. The next morning, the inundation having
                        still continued to increase, the first floor was completely under water, and barring all
                        egress, we were obliged to get a boat <pb xml:id="II.4"/> from the upper windows, and drove
                        to Pisa, where <persName>Shelley</persName> had already taken an apartment&#8212;a Terreno
                        in the Casa, next door to the Marble Palace, with the enigmatical inscription,
                                &#8220;<q><foreign>Alla Giornata,</foreign></q>&#8221; an inscription that has
                        puzzled much the antiquary to explain, and with which title a Novel has been written, which
                        I have never seen. Perhaps there is no mystery in &#8220;<q><foreign>Alla
                                Giornata,</foreign></q>&#8221; which means, erected by day-work, instead of
                        contract, the usual mode of building in Italy. But <persName>Shelley</persName> was
                        inclined to think that there was some deep and mystical meaning in the words, and was but
                        little satisfied with this prosaic interpretation, and deemed it was a tribute to the East,
                        where the proprietor had past his best days, and made his colossal fortune. I have
                        mentioned this magnificent palace, in order to identify the house where
                            <persName>Shelley</persName> lived, the name of which has escaped me. </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch21-3"> We here fixed ourselves for the winter, if such an expression be applicable
                        to the divine climate of that gifted city, &#8220;<q>where autumn <pb xml:id="II.5"/>
                            merges into spring, after but a few days of bleaker weather.</q>&#8221; </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch21-4"> I was suffering from the effects of my abode in the East, and placed myself
                        under the hands of the celebrated <persName key="AnBerli1826">Vacca</persName>, of whom
                            <persName key="PeShell1822">Shelley</persName> and <persName key="LdByron">Lord
                            Byron</persName> both speak with deserved praise. </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch21-5"> During a long and severe attack of illness, aggravated by the fatigues of
                        my journey from Geneva, <persName key="PeShell1822">Shelley</persName> tended me like a
                        brother. He applied my leeches, administered my medicines, and during six weeks that I was
                        confined to my room, was assiduous and unintermitting in his affectionate care of
                        me,&#8212;care I shall never forget; most ungrateful should I indeed be, were it not
                        indelibly stamped on my memory. </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch21-6"> During this imprisonment, it was, that I first had an opportunity of
                        reading his works, with many of which I was unacquainted. The delight they afforded me
                        often disarmed pain. I loved to trace in them, from our crude attempts at rhyme, his
                        earliest thoughts, associated as they were with the recollections of our boy-<pb
                            xml:id="II.6"/>hood; to follow the development of his genius. Nor was it only from his
                        printed poems that I learned to estimate his surpassing talents, he lent me a MS. volume,
                        containing his <name type="title" key="PeShell1822.OdeLiberty">Ode to Liberty</name>, <name
                            type="title" key="PeShell1822.SenstivePlant">The Sensitive Plant</name>, the exquisite
                            <name type="title" key="PeShell1822.Arethusa">Arethusa and Peneus</name>, and many
                        other of his lyrics, which I devoured, and enthusiastically admired. He was surprised at my
                        enthusiasm, and said to me,&#8212;&#8220;<q>I am disgusted with writing, and were it not
                            for an irresistible impulse, that predominates my better reason, should discontinue so
                            doing.</q>&#8221; On such occasions, he fell into a despondent mood, most distressing
                        to witness, was affected with a prostration of spirits that bent him to the earth, a
                        melancholy too sacred to notice, and which it would have been a vain attempt to dissipate. </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch21-7"> At other times perhaps, however, his features, that bore the impress of
                        suffering, might have been false interpreters of the state of his mind, and his spirit
                        might be lost in reverie, of which state it has been well said, that those subject to <pb
                            xml:id="II.7"/> it, are dissolved into the surrounding atmosphere, or feel as if the
                        surrounding atmosphere were dissolved into their being. Something of this, I have more than
                        once remarked in <persName key="PeShell1822">Shelley</persName>, as we stood watching from
                        my open window in the upper part of the house, the sunsets of Pisa, which are gorgeous
                        beyond any I have ever witnessed; when the waters, the sky, and the marble palaces that
                        line the magnificent crescent of the Lung&#8217; Arno, were glowing with crimson&#8212;the
                        river a flood of molten gold,&#8212;and I seem now to follow its course towards the <hi
                            rend="italic">Ponte al Mare</hi>, till the eye rested on the <hi rend="italic">Torre
                            del Fame</hi>, that frowned in dark relievo on the horizon. On such occasions, after
                        one of these reveries, he would forget himself, lost in admiration, and
                        exclaim,&#8212;&#8220;What a glorious world! There is, after all, something worth living
                        for. This makes me retract the wish that I had never been born.&#8221; </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch21-8"> Other feelings, besides those of disappointment, had tended at this time to
                        wound his <pb xml:id="II.8"/> sensitive spirit. Had it been the <persName key="JoColer1876"
                            >Quarterly Reviewer&#8217;s</persName> object, as it undoubtedly was, to place
                            <persName key="PeShell1822">Shelley</persName> under a ban&#8212;to drive him from the
                        pale of society, he could not have adopted a course more suited to his diabolical purpose.
                        From the time of the appearance of this <name type="title" key="JoColer1876.Revolt"
                            >article</name>, if his friends did not forsake altogether, they, with few exceptions,
                        fell off from him; and with a lacerated heart, only a few months after the appearance of
                        the number, he writes:&#8212;&#8220;<q>I am regarded by all who know, or hear of me, except
                            I think on the whole <hi rend="italic">five</hi> individuals, as a rare prodigy of
                            crime and pollution, whose look even might infect. This <hi rend="italic">five</hi> is
                            a large computation, and I don&#8217;t think I could name more than <hi rend="italic"
                                >three</hi>.</q>&#8221; Who these exceptions were, he does not mention. </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch21-9"> To show what the feeling of the English abroad was against him, in
                        consequence of this vile attack, I will here repeat an anecdote, which I have already given
                        to the world, and which must have highly gratified the re-<pb xml:id="II.9"/>spectable
                        contributor to the <name type="title" key="QuarterlyRev">Quarterly</name>. But a few weeks
                        had elapsed, when a singular and dastardly outrage had been committed on <persName
                            key="PeShell1822">Shelley</persName>. He was at the Post-office, asking for his
                        letters, addressed, as is usual in Italy, <foreign><hi rend="italic"
                            >Poste-restante</hi></foreign>, when a stranger in a military cloak, on hearing him
                        pronounce his name, said, &#8220;<q>What, are you that d&#8212;&#8212;d atheist,
                                <persName>Shelley</persName>?</q>&#8221; and without more preamble, being a tall,
                        powerful man, struck him such a blow that it felled him to the ground, and stunned him. On
                        coming to himself, <persName>Shelley</persName> found the ruffian had disappeared. </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch21-10"> Raving with the insult, he immediately sought his friend, <persName
                            key="GeTighe1837">Mr. Tighe</persName>, the son of the renowned <persName
                            key="MaTighe1810">Psyche Tighe</persName>, who lost no time in taking measures to
                        obtain satisfaction. <persName>Mr. Tighe</persName> was some time in discovering where the
                        cowardly aggressor had put up; but at length tracked him to the Trè Donzelle. There were
                        but few travellers then in the city, and the description of the man tallied exactly with
                        that of an officer in <pb xml:id="II.10"/> the Portuguese service, whose name I have now
                        forgotten. He had, however, started without delay for Genoa, whither <persName>Mr.
                            Tighe</persName> and <persName>Shelley</persName> followed, but without being able to
                        overtake him, or learn his route from that city. </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch21-11"> This anecdote may suggest to the reader the fanaticism which nearly proved
                        fatal to <persName key="BaSpino1677">Spinosa</persName>, who has been branded everywhere
                        but in Germany as an Atheist and Epicurean, but whom <persName key="Noval1801"
                            >Novalis</persName> calls a god-intoxicated man, and whose epicureanism is best
                        disproved by his spending only twopence halfpenny a day on his food. </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch21-12"> One evening as <persName key="BaSpino1677">Spinosa</persName> was coming
                        out of the theatre, where he had been relaxing his overtasked mind, he was startled by the
                        fierce expression of a dark face thrust eagerly before his. The glare of blood-thirsty
                        fanaticism arrested him; a knife gleamed in the air, and he had barely time to parry the
                        blow. It fell upon his chest, but fortunately deadened in its force, only tore his coat.
                        The assassin escaped&#8212;<persName>Spinosa</persName> walked home thoughtful. </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch21-13"> The <persName key="GeLewes1878">author</persName> of the <name
                            type="title" key="GeLewes1878.Biographical">Biography of Philosophy</name>, one of the
                        most acute and candid works I ever met with, compares <persName key="PeShell1822"
                            >Shelley</persName> and <persName key="BaSpino1677">Spinosa</persName> together, and
                        does ample justice to their characters. Speaking of <persName>Shelley&#8217;s</persName>
                        ostracism, he says,&#8212;&#8220;<q>Like the young and energetic
                                <persName>Shelley</persName>, who afterwards imitated him, he found himself an
                            outcast in the busy world, with no other guides through its perplexing labyrinths than
                            sincerity and self-dependence. Two or three new friends soon presented themselves, men
                            who warred against their religion, as he had warred against his own; and a bond of
                            sympathy was forged out of the common injustice. Here again we trace a resemblance to
                                <persName>Shelley</persName>, who, discountenanced by his relations, sought among a
                            few sceptical friends, to supply the affection he was thus deprived of. Like
                                <persName>Spinosa</persName>, he too had only sisters with whom he had been brought
                            up. No doubt, in both cases, the consciousness of sincerity, and the pride of
                            martyrdom, were great shields in the combat with society. They are <pb xml:id="II.12"/>
                            always so, and it is well they are so, or the battle would never be fought; but they
                            never entirely replace the affections. Shut from our family, we may seek a brotherhood
                            of apostacy, but the new and precarious intellectual sympathies are no compensations
                            for the loss of the emotive sympathies, with all the links of association and all the
                            memories of childhood. <persName>Spinosa</persName> must have felt this, and as
                                <persName>Shelley</persName> in a rash marriage endeavoured to fill up the void of
                            his yearning heart, so <persName>Spinosa</persName> must, we think, swayed by the same
                            feeling, have sought the daughter of his friend and master, <persName>Vander

                        had for the first time studied the original, praising the fidelity of the version&#8212;it
                        by no means satisfied him. What he meant by an adequate translation, was, one in terza
                        rima; for in <persName key="PeShell1822">Shelley&#8217;s</persName> own words, he held it
                        an essential justice to an author, to render him in the same form. I asked him if he had

                        uninteresting to know what he thought of the merits of others of them. He had, as I have
                        said, been in early life a great admirer of <persName key="RoSouth1843">Southey</persName>,
                        and took him as his metrical model, but he told me that when his taste became more
                        fastidious, he looked upon him in the light of an improvisatore. &#8220;<q>What do you mean
                            by that, <persName>Shelley</persName>?</q>&#8221; I asked. &#8220;<q>I mean,</q>&#8221;
                        he replied, &#8220;<q>that he has fancy, imagination, taste,&#8212;that he is facile and

                            far as words go, but no further; he moves, but does not touch the heart. One reads him
                            with delight once, but never takes him up a second time; besides, his subjects possess

                            has sprung out of it, have spawned a set of words neither Chaucerian nor Spencerian,
                            words such as &#8220;glib,&#8221; and &#8220;flush,&#8221; &#8220;whiffling,&#8221;

                            their literature. Poetry was mown with the scythe, and levelled with the roller, till

                            language of set phrases and forms of speech. They quitted <persName key="MiMonta1592"

                            They owe this to an acquaintance with our writers, and something to the

                    <p xml:id="ch23-1"> The life <persName key="PeShell1822">Shelley</persName> led at Pisa was one
                        of much isolation, but not so complete as it had been. <persName key="AlMavro1865">Prince
                            Mavrocordato</persName> was his constant visitor; with him he read the Paradise Lost,
                        and as both were great linguists, the task was rendered the easier. Speaking of this,
                            <persName>Shelley</persName> used to say that &#8220;<q>in interpreting a foreign
                            tongue, it was a great mutual advantage to know several; for that hence synonymes,
                            which failed in one, could be found in another;</q>&#8221; and thus he would often give
                        the exact meaning of a word in Italian, or Spanish, or Latin, or still more frequently in
                        Greek, which he found the best medium as regarded the <name type="title"
                            key="JoMilto1674.Paradise">Paradise Lost</name>,&#8212;perhaps the most difficult of
                        all poems to explain. Let him who doubts it make the experiment. In return, the prince read
                        with us the <name type="title" key="Aesch456.Agamemnon">Agamemnon</name>, though
                            <persName>Shelley</persName> little approved of his emendations, and would not admit
                        that a modern Greek was a better scholiast than an English scholar. He admitted,
                            &#8220;<q>that he might know better the names of plants and flowers, but had no
                            advantage over <pb xml:id="II.41"/> a foreigner in correcting the faults, or supplying
                            the <hi rend="italic">hiatuses</hi> in the text; the best proof of which was, that with
                            a solitary exception, <persName key="AnMusto1860">Mustoxidi</persName>, modern Greece
                            has produced no great philologist.</q>&#8221; Nor could
                            <persName>Shelley&#8217;s</persName> ears, accustomed to our pronunciation, endure
                            <persName>Mavrocordato&#8217;s</persName>, which the latter contended was the only
                        right one. </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch23-2">
                        <persName key="PeShell1822">Shelley</persName> would as little adopt the Italian mode as to
                        Latin, and used to say, &#8220;<q>that if we were wrong, we erred with <persName
                                key="DeErasm1536">Erasmus</persName>.</q>&#8221; I remember pointing out to him in
                            <persName key="TiPlautu">Plautus</persName>, a play on the words <foreign><hi
                                rend="italic">arca</hi></foreign> and <foreign><hi rend="italic"
                            >arce</hi></foreign>, which latter must have been pronounced <foreign><hi rend="italic"
                                >arke</hi></foreign>. <persName>Shelley</persName> told me he never read Latin, and
                        looked on the Romans as pale copyists of the Greeks; not that he was insensible to the
                        beauty of <persName key="PuVirgi">Virgil</persName>, but thought his <name type="title"
                            key="PuVirgi.Eclogues">Eclogues</name> poor and artificial compared with the Pastorals
                        of <persName key="Theoc260">Theocritus</persName>. &#8220;<q>Greek,</q>&#8221; said he,
                            &#8220;<q>is as superior to Latin, as German is to French; and the Augustan age bears
                            the same relation to that of <persName key="TiLucre">Lucretius</persName>, as <persName
                                key="QuAnne">Queen Anne&#8217;s</persName> did to the Elizabethean.</q>&#8221; </p>

                    <pb xml:id="II.42"/>

                    <p xml:id="ch23-3"> But to return to <persName key="AlMavro1865">Mavrocordato</persName>. There
                        was at that time little prospect of a Greek revolution, though the subject frequently
                        formed part of our conversation. It was a favourite speculation of <persName
                            key="PeShell1822">Shelley&#8217;s</persName>, and with a prophetic spirit he
                        anticipated the emancipation of that oppressed race; and <persName>Mavrocordato</persName>,
                        warmed by these aspirations for the independence of his country, which indeed filled the
                        hearts of so many of his countrymen, half resolved to believe, almost against reason, that
                        an insurrection in Greece was possible; but had no idea it was so near at hand.
                            <persName>Shelley</persName> entertained a sincere regard for <persName>Prince
                            Mavrocordato</persName>, who had very enlarged and enlightened views of the state of
                        Europe. He says of him,&#8212;&#8220;<q>I know one Greek of the highest qualities, both of
                            courage and conduct, the <persName>Prince Mavrocordato</persName>, and if the rest be
                            like him, all will go well.</q>&#8221; Whether <persName>Shelley&#8217;s</persName>
                        opinion of this statesman has been confirmed by his career, it remains for some future
                            <persName key="Thucy399">Thucydides</persName> to decide. The prince was at that time
                            <pb xml:id="II.43"/> occupied in compiling a dictionary of modern and ancient Greek.
                        Whether he completed it I know not. From time to time he used to shew us a modern Greek
                        translation of the <name type="title" key="Homer800.Iliad">Iliad</name>, then publishing in
                        monthly numbers in Paris; but <persName>Shelley&#8217;s</persName> knowledge of the
                        language as at present spoken, was very superficial. They used also occasionally to play at
                        chess, but as neither <persName key="Napoleon1">Napoleon</persName> nor <persName
                            key="Charles12">Charles XII.</persName> shone at that game, it is less to be wondered
                        that a poet and politician should not be great proficients in such tactics. </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch23-4"> Among his other guests, <persName key="GiRosin1855">Rosini</persName> (the
                        author of that episode to the <name type="title" key="AlManzo1873.Betrothed">Promesse
                            Spose</name>, the &#8220;<hi rend="italic">Monoca di Monza,</hi>&#8221;) made
                        occasionally one; but no intimacy subsisted between them. <persName key="ThSgric1836"
                            >Sgricci</persName> also passed some evenings at his house. He was perhaps the greatest
                        of <hi rend="italic">improvisatores</hi> that existed, and gave us more than one specimen
                        of his talent. He used to say that &#8220;<q>the God when invoked was always
                            propitious.</q>&#8221; He was on his way to Lucca, there to give a tragedy <pb
                            xml:id="II.44"/> on the stage, as he had done at Paris, where his improvisations were
                        taken down in shorthand, and published; but they did not bear strict criticism, though they
                        abound in passages of great beauty. <persName key="PeShell1822">Shelley</persName> went to
                        Lucca, to be present at his acting, and came back wonder-struck; of several subjects
                        proposed at random, he selected the <name type="title" key="Eurip406.Iphigenia">Iphigenia
                            in Tauris</name>, and I remember <persName>Shelley&#8217;s</persName> admiring greatly
                        his comparing <persName type="fiction">Orestes</persName> to one high column, all that
                        remained for the support of a house. <persName>Shelley</persName> said that &#8220;<q>his
                            appearance on the stage, his manner of acting, the intonations of his voice, varied to
                            suit the characters he impersonated, had a magical effect, and that his Chorusses in
                            the most intricate metres, were worthy of the Greeks.</q>&#8221; This was, I believe,
                        the last time <persName>Sgricci</persName> appeared on the boards of a theatre. He soon
                        after obtained a pension from the <persName key="Ferdinand3">Grand-duke of
                            Tuscany</persName>, and his pension extinguished his genius. There is a proverb, that
                        singing birds must not be too well fed! He died in 1826 or 1827, still young. </p>

                        merits, for he was an ardent lover of his country, and enthusiastical for the emancipation
                        of Italy, was also <persName>Shelley&#8217;s</persName> particular friend; but his great
                        practice left him little leisure for visits, besides that the state of his health, that
                        shortly after brought him to an untimely grave, made his professional fatigues require a
                        repose, that even conversation in his leisure hours would have disturbed. He died of

                        <persName key="PeShell1822">Shelley</persName> had indeed during that winter been subject
                        to a prostration, physical and psychical, <pb xml:id="II.46"/> the most cruel to witness,
                        though he was never querulous or out of temper, never by an irritable word hurt the
                        feelings of those about him. I have accounted already for the causes of his dejection and
                        despondency. His imagination was his greatest enemy&#8212;that poetical temperament which
                        those who possess it not, cannot comprehend, is no enviable gift. So sensitive was he of
                        external impressions, so magnetic, that I have seen him, after threading the crowd in the
                        Lung&#8217; Arno Corsos, throw himself half fainting into a chair, overpowered by the
                        atmosphere of evil passions, as he used to say, in that sensual and unintellectual crowd.
                        In order to shelter himself from this feeling, he would fly to his pen or books. He was
                        indeed ever engaged in composition or reading, scarcely allowing himself time for exercise
                        or air; a book was his companion the first thing in the morning, the last thing at night.
                        He told me he always read himself to sleep. Even when he walked on the <hi rend="italic"
                            >Argine</hi>, his favourite winter walk, he read&#8212;sometimes through <pb
                            xml:id="II.47"/> the streets, and generally had a book on the table by his side at
                        dinner, if his abstemious meal could be called one. So little impression did that which
                        contributes one of the main delights of ordinary mortals, make on him, that he sometimes
                        asked, &#8220;<q><persName key="MaShell1851">Mary</persName>, have I dined?</q>&#8221; Wine
                        he never drank; water, which as I have said, is super-excellent at Pisa, being his chief
                        beverage. Not but he was a lover of tea, calling himself sometimes humorously a <hi
                            rend="italic">Théist</hi>. Let not, however, my readers imagine that he was always
                        dejected or despondent,&#8212;at times he was as sportive as his child, (with whom he would
                        play by the hour on the floor,) and his wit flowed in a continuous stream,&#8212;not that
                        broad humour which is so much in vogue at the present day, but a genuine wit, classical I
                        might say, and refined, that caused a smile rather than a laugh. </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch23-9"> I have alluded to his physical sufferings&#8212;they, if they did not
                        produce, tended to aggravate his mental ones. He was a martyr to the most painful
                        complaint, Nephritis, for which he had, <pb xml:id="II.48"/> though with no alleviation,
                        consulted the most eminent medical men, at home and abroad, and now was trying
                            <persName>Scott&#8217;s</persName> vitriolic acid baths, much in vogue. This malady
                        constantly menaced to end fatally. During its paroxysms he would roll on the floor in
                        agony. I had seen animal magnetism practised in India&#8212;had myself benefited by it at
                        Geneva, and at his earnest request, consented to try its efficacy on him during his next
                        attack. One of them affected him during an evening, when two ladies, one of whom was
                            <persName key="MaShell1851">Mrs. Shelley</persName>, were present. The imposition of my
                        hand on hie forehead, instantly put a stop to his spasms, and threw him into a deep
                        slumber, which for want of a better name has been called somnambulism. He slept with his
                        eyes open. During the continuance of it, I led him from one part of the room to the sofa in
                        the other end; and when the trance was overpast, after the manner of all somnambulists, he
                        would not admit that he had slept, or that he had made any replies, which I elicited from
                        him by questioning; <pb xml:id="II.49"/> those replies being pitched in the same tone of
                        voice as my own. He also during a second experiment improvised some Italian verses, which
                        were faultless, although he had at that time never written one. <persName key="PeShell1822"
                            >Shelley</persName> had never previously heard of Mesmerism, and I shewed him a
                        treatise I composed, embodying most of the facts recorded by its adepts, and he was
                        particularly struck by a passage in <persName key="PuTacit">Tacitus</persName>, no
                        credulous historian, who seriously related two cases (witnessed he says by many living) in
                        Egypt, that might stagger the most sceptical. &#8220;<q>Does it lead to materialism or
                            immaterialism?</q>&#8221; <persName>Shelley</persName> thought to the
                            latter&#8212;&#8220;<q>that a separation from the mind and body took
                        place</q>&#8221;&#8212;the one being most active and the other an inert mass of matter. He
                        deduced from this phenomenon an additional argumen for the immortality of the soul, of
                        which no man was more fully persuaded. </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch23-10"> After my departure from Pisa, he was magnetised by a lady, which gave rise
                        to the beautiful stanzas entitled &#8220;<name type="title" key="PeShell1822.Magnetic">The
                            Magnetic Lady to <pb xml:id="II.50"/> her Patient</name>,&#8221; and during which
                        operation, he made the same reply to an inquiry as to his disease, and its cure, as he had
                        done to me,&#8212;&#8220;<q>What would cure me would kill me,</q>&#8221;&#8212;meaning
                        lithotomy. <persName key="MaShell1851">Mrs. Shelley</persName> also magnetised him, but
                        soon discontinued the practice, from finding that he got up in his sleep, and went one
                        night to the window, (fortunately barred,) having taken to his old habit of sleep-walking,
                        which I mentioned, in his boyhood, and also in London. </p>

                        length, on the Life of Christ, and which <persName key="MaShell1851">Mrs.
                            Shelley</persName> should give to the world. In this work he differs little from
                            <persName key="HePaulu1851">Paulus</persName>, <persName key="DaStrau1874"
                            >Strauss</persName>, and the Rationalists of Germany. The first of these has been for
                        fifty years professor of divinity in the university of Heidelberg, and is venerated with
                        honours due to his talents and exemplary virtues; the latter once filled the theological
                        chair at Zurich, from which he was ousted by the Jesuits. </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch23-12"> The new sect which has lately sprung up, with <persName key="JoRonge1887"
                            >Ronge</persName> at its head, whose doctrines were running like wildfire through the
                        Confederation, but are now at the ebb-tide,&#8212;this New Catholicism which it was once
                        proposed by the Baden Chamber to make one of the religions of the state, proves the wide
                        dissemination which Rationalism has had, and the revolution in men&#8217;s minds in
                        Germany. Rongeism is only a more extended form of Unitarianism. </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch23-13"> But the Rongeists go far beyond the Unitarians or Rationalists, and have
                        so refined away the tenets of our religion, discarding prophecy, miracles, the divinity of
                        our Saviour, and the atonement, that they can scarcely be denominated Christians. </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch23-14"> Shelley, in this treatise, does no more than <persName key="DaStrau1874"
                            >Strauss</persName>, <persName key="HePaulu1851">Paulus</persName>, and <persName
                            key="JoRonge1887">Ronge</persName>; he indeed treats the subject with more respect than
                        either, and although he may reduce Christianity to a code of morals, how does he differ in
                        so doing from the <pb xml:id="II.52"/> Unitarians, though I am aware that this by some
                        casuistry they do not admit? </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch23-15"> But without entering on this discussion, which might lead me too far out
                        of the track, I can say, with reference to <persName key="PeShell1822">Shelley</persName>,
                        that whatever his early opinions might have been, he on becoming a Platonist, firmly
                        believed in a future state. He used to say, that &#8220;<q>no man who reflected could be a

                        <persName key="PeShell1822">Shelley</persName> used to say, that every city or town had its

                        to offer an abstract idea of the effects they produce. This preamble brings me to the Devil
                        of Pisa. <persName key="FrPacci1835">P&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</persName> was about fifty
                        years of age, somewhat above the common height, with a <pb xml:id="II.55"/> figure boney
                        and angular, and covered with no more superfluous flesh than a prize-fighter. His face was
                        dark as that of a Moor, his features marked and regular, his eyes black and gloomy. He
                        always reminded me of one of <persName key="Titia1576">Titian&#8217;s</persName> portraits
                        (his family had been Venetians,) stepping out of its frame. Had he lived when Venice was
                        governed by the Tré, he would have made a <persName type="fiction">Loredano</persName>, and
                        might have sate to <persName key="AnRadcl1823">Anne Ratcliffe</persName> for a <persName
                            type="fiction">Schedoni</persName>; but to descend to modern times, during the reign of
                        Austrian despotism he was admirably calculated for a spy, or <foreign><hi rend="italic"
                                >calderaio</hi></foreign>,&#8212;perhaps he might be one. &#8220;<foreign><hi
                                rend="italic">Chi lo sa</hi></foreign>.&#8221; Nature certainly never designed him
                        for a divine. As to his religion, it was about on a par with that of <persName
                            key="GiCasti1803">Il Abbate Casti</persName>, (<foreign><hi rend="italic">Casti a non

                        city, Florence. But at Pisa, <foreign><hi rend="italic">II Signore
                            Professore</hi></foreign> was the title by which he was generally known; a professor,
                        like many other professors and lecturers, at least in Italy, who had made a <pb
                            xml:id="II.56"/> sinecure of his office, that of <hi rend="italic">Belles Lettres</hi>,
                        and only mounted the Cathedra once, during the many years that he touched his poor
                        emoluments; for the Transalpine universities are not quite so richly endowed as our own.
                        Not that this neglect of his duties would have affected his appointment, but as he told me,
                        he lost it by an irresistible <hi rend="italic">bon mot</hi>. During one of his midnight
                        orgies, which he was in the habit of celebrating with some of the most dissolute of the
                        students, he was interrogated in the darkness, by the patrole in the streets of Pisa, as to
                        who and what he was; to which questioning he gave the following reply:
                            &#8220;<foreign>Son&#8217; un uomo publico, in una strada publica, con una donna
                            publica</foreign>.&#8221; This public avowal cost him his chair. But it gave him <hi
                            rend="italic">eclat</hi>, and did not lose him his friends, or exclude him from the
                        houses where he was the spiritual guide and confessor. There were, it is true, two reasons
                        why he was tolerated in good society, (which <persName>Casti</persName> says is to be found
                        where he places <persName type="fiction">Don Juan</persName>, below,)&#8212;his pen and his
                            <pb xml:id="II.57"/> tongue&#8212;the dread of both. His epigrams were <foreign><hi
                                rend="italic">sanglantes</hi></foreign>, and he gave <hi rend="italic"
                            >soubriquets</hi> the most happy for those who offended him; as an instance of which,
                        he most happily styled a captain of our navy, <foreign><hi rend="italic">il dolce
                                capitano;</hi></foreign> a bye-word that stuck to him through life, and always
                        excited a smile at his expense whenever he appeared. He was a good poet, if one might judge
                        from the quotations he was in the habit of making from his tragedies, which he continually
                        talked about, and which <persName key="GeStael1817">Madame de Staël</persName>, who knew
                        him, used to call his <hi rend="italic">imaginary</hi> ones, for not a line of them
                        was-ever published&#8212;perhaps written. His talent was conversation&#8212;a conversation
                        full of repartee, and sparkling with wit; and his information (he was a man of profound
                        erudition, vast memory, and first-rate talent,) made him almost oracular.
                            <persName>Shelley</persName>, when <persName>P&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</persName> first
                        became an <hi rend="italic">habitué</hi> at his house, was charmed with him, and listened
                        with rapt attention to his eloquence, which he compared to that of <persName
                            key="SaColer1834">Coleridge</persName>. It was a swarm of ideas singularly ex-<pb
                            xml:id="II.58"/>ravagant, but which he contrived to weave into his argument with
                        marvellous embroidery. Now he plunged into abysses but to lighten other abysses; and his
                        words, like a torrent&#8212; for there was no stopping him when fairly rushing
                        onwards&#8212;carried all before them. </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch24-2"> It was this gift of eloquence that made him for a time welcome at <persName

                        say,&#8212;for he had in the outset sufficient tact (no one knew mankind better) to keep in
                        the background the revolting vices which were familiar to him and disfigured his character.

                        of the rent, from the landlord; for a picture fancier, he had always at hand some

                                di casa</hi></foreign> and confessor to a noble family, one of the most
                        distinguished for its antiquity of any at Pisa, where its head then filled a post of great
                        authority. By his first countess he had two grown-up daughters, and in his old age had the
                        boldness, the audacity I might say, to take unto himself a wife not much older than either.
                        This lady, whose beauty did not rival that of the Count&#8217;s children, was naturally
                        jealous of their charms, and deemed them dangerous rivals in the eyes of her Cavaliere; and
                        exerting all her influence over her infatuated husband, persuaded him, though their
                        education was completed, to immure them in two convents (pensions, I should say, or as they
                        are called, <foreign><hi rend="italic">conservatorios</hi></foreign>) in his native city.
                        The Professor who had known them from infancy, and been their instructor in languages and
                        polite literature, made the <hi rend="italic">Contessinas</hi> frequent subjects of <pb
                            xml:id="II.61"/> conversation. He told us that the father was not over rich, owing to
                        his young wife&#8217;s extravagance; that he was avaricious withal, and did not like to
                        disburse their dowries, which, as fixed by law, must be in proportion to the father&#8217;s
                        fortune, and was waiting till some one would take them off his hands without a <foreign><hi

                        she had been confined for two years in the convent of St. A&#8212;&#8212;.
                            &#8220;<q>Poverina,</q>&#8221; he said, with a deep sigh, &#8220;<q>she pines like a

                            love. Yesterday she was watering some flowers in her cell&#8212;she has nothing else to
                            love but her flowers&#8212;&#8216;Yes,&#8217; said she, addressing them, &#8216;you are

                        After passing through a gloomy portal, that led to a quadrangle, the area of which was

                        displayed to its full height, her brow, fair as that of the marble of which I speak. She
                        was also of about the same height as the antique. Her features possessed a rare
                        faultlessness, and almost Grecian contour, the nose and forehead making a straight
                        line,&#8212;a style of face so rare, that I remember <persName key="LoBarto1850"

                        Her cheek was pale, too, as marble, owing to her confinement and want of air, or perhaps
                        &#8220;to thought.&#8221; There was a lark in the <foreign><hi rend="italic"

                                Io non sono che amore. Io non posso esistere senza amare. La mia anima, il mia

                                Amore é un fuoco, che brucciando non distrugge, una mista di piacere e di pena, una

                        <q>Love! soul of the world! Love, the source of all that is good, of all that is lovely!
                            what would the <pb xml:id="II.70"/> universe be, failing thy creative flame? A horrible
                            desert. But far from this, it is the sole shadow of all goodness, of all loveliness,
                            and of all felicity. Of that love I speak, that possessing itself of all our soul, of
                            our entire will, sublimes and raises one, above every other individual of the same
                            species; and all energetic, all pure, all divine, inspires none but actions that are
                            magnanimous, and worthy of the followers of that sweet and omnipotent deity. The lover!
                            no! he is not confounded with the herd of men, he does net degrade his soul, but
                            elevates, drives on, and crowns it with light at the smile of the divinity. He becomes
                            a supereminent being, and as such altogether incomprehensible. The universe&#8212;the
                            vast universe, no longer capable of bounding his ideas, his affections, vanishes from
                            before his sight. The soul of him who loves disdains restraint&#8212;nothing can
                            restrain it. It lances itself out of the created, and creates in the infinite a world
                            for itself, and for itself alone, how different from this obscure and fearful
                            den!&#8212;is in the continued enjoyment of the sweetest extacy, is truly happy. All
                            that has no relation to the object of its tenderness&#8212;all that is not that adored
                            object, appears an insignificant point to his eyes. But where is he, susceptible of
                            such love? Where? Who is capable of inspiring it? Oh love! I am all love. I cannot
                            exist without love! My soul&#8212;my mortal frame&#8212;all my thoughts and affections,
                            all that which I am, transfigures itself into <pb xml:id="II.71"/> one sole sentiment
                            of love, and that sentiment will last eternally. Without Love, life would become to me
                            insupportable&#8212;the world an inhospitable and desolate desert, only haunted by
                            spectres, so terrible to my sight, that to fly from them, I could cast myself into the
                            mysterious but tranquil abode of death. Ah! yes! I prefer the sweet pains of love, the
                            continual throbbings that accompany, the fear inseparable from it, to a to me stupid
                            calm, and to all the pleasures that can supply the gratification of all other passions,
                            all the goods (if without love there can be any good) which the world prizes and
                            covets.</q>

                            vile and degrading, to crime&#8212;ah! execrable iniquity! when even to crime itself

                            magnanimous, of true felicity&#8212;Love is a fire that burns and destroys not, a
                            mixture of pleasure and of pain a pain that brings pleasure, an essence eternal,
                            spiritual, infinite, pure, celestial. This is the true, the only Love,&#8212;that
                            sentiment which can alone entirely <pb xml:id="II.72"/> fill up the void of the
                            soul&#8212;that horrible void, worse than death. Every other sentiment dissimilar from
                            this, than this less pure, deserves not the sacred name of Love; and they who impiously
                            profane and defile it, shall be punished by that most mighty of Divinities, and shall
                            merit eternal perdition. Where the soul that is feelingly alive seeks for love, and
                            finds itself in the abyss of desolation, and where the heart is divested of this sweet
                            fire, or finds faithless the object of its tenderness,&#8212;that miserable soul, let
                            it seek (at least I so counsel it), let it seek, I say, its refuge in the tomb, and
                            feed upon it as its last consolation.</q>

                        disrepair. The court leading to it, overgrown with weeds, proved that it had been <pb

                        long passages and rooms, many of the windows in which were broken, and let in the cold
                        blasts from &#8220;<q>the wind-swept Apennine;</q>&#8221; and opening at length a door,
                        ushered us into a chamber, where a small bed and a couple of chairs formed the whole
                        furniture. The couch was covered with white gauze curtains, to exclude the gnats; behind
                        them was lying a female form. She immediately recognised me&#8212;was probably prepared for
                        my visit&#8212;and extended her thin hand to me in greeting. So changed that recumbent

                        she led a life of purgatory, and had at length broken the chain, with the consent of her

                        property might have been restored to him,&#8212;he was almost left destitute, and before
                        leaving England, had not a hundred pounds he could call his own. His highly sensitive and
                        proud spirit, that brooked not dependence, and the prospect of the future, preyed on him
                        like eating fire. </p>

                            interesting, and his spirits good, excepting at moments when anxiety regarding his
                            brother&#8217;s health dejected them. His own illness, that commenced in January 1820,
                            began from inflammation in the lungs, from cold. In. coughing, he ruptured a
                            blood-vessel. An hereditary tendency to consumption was aggravated by the excessive
                            susceptibility of his temperament, for I never see those often quoted lines of

                            idea of <persName key="JoKeats1821">Keats</persName>. That his sensibility was most
                            acute, is true, and his passions were very strong, but not violent, if by that term,
                            violence of temper is implied. His was no doubt susceptible, but his anger seemed
                            rather to turn on himself than on others, and in moments of greatest irritation, it was
                            only by a sort of savage despondency that he sometimes grieved and wounded his friends.
                            Violence such as the letter describes, was quite foreign to his nature. For more than a
                            twelvemonth before quitting England, I saw him every day, often witnessed his
                            sufferings, both mental and bodily, and I do not hesitate to say, that he never could
                            have addressed an unkind expression, much less a violent one, to any human being. <pb

                                <persName>John Keats</persName>, we cannot, after all, find in our hearts to be
                            glad now thou art gone away with the swallows to a kindlier climate. The rains began to
                            fall heavily the moment thou wast to go&#8212;we do not say, poet-like, for thy
                            departure. One tear, in an honest eye, is more precious to the sight than all the
                            metaphysical weepings in the universe, and thou didst leave many starting, to think how
                            many months it would be till they saw you again. And yet thou didst love metaphorical
                            tears too, in their way, and couldst always liken everything in nature to something
                            great or small. And the rains that beat against thy cabin window will set, we fear, thy
                            ever-working wits upon many comparisons, which ought to be much more painful to others
                            than thyself. Heaven mend their envious and ignorant numskulls! But thou hast a mighty
                            soul in a little body, and the kind cares of the former, for all about thee, shall no
                            longer subject the latter to the chance of <pb xml:id="II.95"/> impressions which it
                            scorns, and the soft skies of Italy shall breathe balm upon it, and thou shalt return
                            with thy friend the nightingale, and make all thy other friends as happy with thy
                            voice, as they are sorrowful to miss it. The little cage thou didst sometimes share
                            with us, looks as deficient without thee as thy present one may do without us. But
                            farewell for a while! Thy heart is in our fields, and thou wilt soon be back to rejoin
                            it.</q>&#8221; </p>

                        voyage,&#8212;it was full of mishaps. At the very commencement of it, they were obliged by
                        stress of weather, to put into a port on the coast of Hampshire, and disembark. They met
                        with a violent storm on the passage, and it is a miracle that <persName key="JoKeats1821"

                            board.&#8212;&#8220;<q>It has been unfortunate for me that one of the passengers is a
                            young lady in a consumption. Her imprudence has vexed me very much. The knowledge of
                            her complaint&#8212;the flushings in her face, all her bad symptoms have preyed upon
                            me. They would have done so, had I been in good health. I shall feel a load off me,

                        symptoms seem to have been very much aggravated by this ill-judged voyage. He appears to
                        have reached Naples on the 24th October, prostrated in mind and body. His stay there was
                        short, and his journey to Rome attended by great inconvenience; for one whole day they were
                        without food, a severe privation to one so debilitated. I imagine this to have occurred on
                        the crossing the Pontine Marshes, from Mola de Gaetà to Cisterna. Indeed, this journey,
                        combined with the voyage, would have tried the constitution of one in health, but was fatal
                        to an invalid. </p>

                                    my eyes. I wish many times that he had never left you. His recovery must have
                                    been impossible, before he left England, and his excessive grief would, in any
                                    case, have made it so. In your case, he seems to me like an infant in its
                                    mother&#8217;s arms. You would have soothed his pains, and his death might have
                                    been eased by the presence of his many friends; but here, with one solitary
                                    friend, in a place <pb xml:id="II.98"/> savage for an invalid, he has had
                                    another pang added to the many. </p>

                                    from him the trouble I have had in so doing. I have not been able to leave
                                    him&#8212;that is, I dared not do so, except when he slept. Had he come here
                                    alone, he would have sunk into the grave in silence, and we should not have
                                    known one syllable about him. This reflection repays me for what I have done. </p>

                            man. Lord Byron&#8217;s opinion, that he was killed by the reviewers, is wholly

                        had not been encouraged to complete a work worthy of <persName key="JoMilto1674"
                            >Milton</persName>. He used to say that &#8220;<q>the scenery and drawing of his

                            <persName>Shelley</persName> had this little volume continually in his pocket, the best
                        proof of his appreciation of its merits. Nothing more deeply affected
                            <persName>Shelley</persName> than the premature removal from a world, that deserved to
                        lose him, of <persName>Keats</persName>. <persName>Shelley</persName> thought that he died
                        too soon for his fame, great as it is; had he lived to bask in the warm south, to drink
                        deep of the warm south, to draw his inspiration from purer sources; had he not been
                        flattered and <pb xml:id="II.111"/> stimulated into writing from false models, turned as he
                        was daily become more and more from the error of his ways, what might he not have produced?
                        The prohibition of his physicians, to write after his first attack, was cruelly felt by
                            <persName>Keats</persName>. Poetry had been his &#8220;safety valve.&#8221; His
                        imagination now preyed on itself&#8212;he longed to redeem his fame. Not that, as <hi
                            rend="italic">some</hi> accused him, he had been idle,&#8212;and when we consider that
                        he had only begun to write in 1817, (he was little more than 24 when he died) one wonders
                        that less than four years should have effected so much. His earliest
                        productions&#8212;though they were so disfigured by a false and affected phraseology, that
                        the one beginning, &#8220;<name type="title" key="JoKeats1821.IStood">I stood tiptoe upon a

                        them in 1815 and 1816, might be mistaken for his prototype&#8217;s. If we compare them with
                        those of <persName>Shelley</persName>, how far superior are they, how much greater promise
                        do they not hold out of ultimate excellency! and his more finished ones make us <pb

                        from one of <persName key="OlCromw1658">Cromwell&#8217;s</persName> daughters) had, with
                        his moderate wishes, what might be considered a sufficiency, but unhappily, a great part of
                        his fortune was swallowed up in the bankruptcy of a house in Calcutta, where it was lodged.
                        Another misfortune attended him, soon after taking up his abode in Pisa; he was seized with
                        a pulmonary complaint, which he attributed to sleeping in a bed where a consumptive patient
                        had died. The Italians, and still more the Spanish, consider the atmosphere of rooms to be
                        infected by such patients, and the laws (though the regulations of the police are sometimes
                        infringed, which did not occur in <persName key="JoKeats1821">Keats&#8217;s</persName>
                        case) strictly enjoin that all the furniture in the apartments of those who have died of
                        the complaint, is to be destroyed. <persName>Williams</persName> certainly when he came to
                        Pisa never showed any symptoms of phthisis, which soon took deep root in his constitution,
                        and as appears by a letter of <persName key="PeShell1822">Shelley&#8217;s</persName>, where
                        he says, &#8220;<q><persName>Williams</persName> must go on <pb xml:id="II.119"/> with the

                        regard. Pisa was full of victims to this insidious disease, and I have often observed
                            <persName>Shelley</persName> in our walks made deeply melancholy by the sight of a
                        lovely and interesting girl, crawling along&#8212; <q>

                        impotently in the dust. <persName>Williams</persName> also (as <persName>Keats</persName>
                        had been on board of the ship,) was deeply affected by the spectacle. He had also a great
                        taste for drawing; his sketches were spirited and masterly; he could illustrate happily
                        from the ideas of others, and took likenesses in general very striking, and it is to him
                        that we are indebted for the only semblance of <persName>Shelley</persName> that exists. It
                        was not a very happy miniature, <pb xml:id="II.120"/> but I should conceive no one so
                        difficult to pourtray, the expression of his countenance being ever flitting and
                        varied,&#8212;now depressed and melancholy, now lit up like that of a spirit,&#8212;making
                        him look one moment forty and the next eighteen. It is said that <persName

                        foreigner&#8217;s. <persName>Williams&#8217;s</persName> sketch has been, it strikes me,
                        greatly altered for the worse in the engraving; the face is too full and oval, the nose too
                        straight and regular,&#8212;the whole wanting in that fire which in moments of inspiration
                        animated him. But to have arrested the smallest shadow of resemblance of that great genius
                        is something. </p>

                        closer to each other, and the similarity of their traits and pursuits served to rivet still
                        more the tie of friendship. <persName>Williams</persName> soon learned to understand
                            <persName>Shelley</persName>&#8212;to <pb xml:id="II.121"/> appreciate him as a poet
                        and a man&#8212;and <persName>Shelley</persName> found in him one who could sympathise with
                        his sufferings, and to whom he could lay open his heart. <persName key="MaShell1851">Mrs.
                            Shelley</persName>, speaking of <persName>Williams</persName>, says, &#8220;<q>that he
                            was her husband&#8217;s favourite companion, that his love of adventure and manly
                            exercise also corresponded with <persName>Shelley&#8217;s</persName> taste.</q>&#8221;

                            pleasures,&#8212;and alas! his fate.</q>&#8221; </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch26-4"> These manly exercises, to which she alludes, were practice with a pistol,
                        and boating. <persName key="EdWilli1822">Williams</persName>, from his early sea-life, was
                        an excellent sailor, and knew all the mysteries of the craft, could cut out sails, make
                        blocks, &amp;c. The Arno has no pleasure-boats, and its shallowness rendered it difficult
                        to get any that drew little water enough to float. They, however, overcame the difficulty,
                        and constructed one, such as the huntsmen carry about with them in the Mahremma, something
                        like a Welch coracle; and in this they ventured down to Leghorn, returning <pb
                            xml:id="II.122"/> to Pisa by the canal, when missing the direct cut, they got entangled
                        among the weeds, and upset. This boat was a great amusement to them during their
                                <foreign><hi rend="italic">villagiatura</hi></foreign> this summer (1821).
                            <persName key="PeShell1822">Shelley</persName> fixed himself again at the baths of St.
                        Julian, and <persName>Williams</persName> at Pagnano, four miles distant. I have heard
                            <persName>Shelley</persName> often speak with rapture of the excursions they made
                        together. The canal fed by the Serchio, of the clearest water, is so rapid, that they were
                        obliged to tow the boat up against the current; but the swift descent, through green banks
                        enamelled with flowers and overhung with trees, that mirrored themselves on its glassy
                        surface, gave him a wonderful delight. He has left a record of these trips in a poem
                        entitled &#8220;<name type="title" key="PeShell1822.Boat">The Boat on the

                        plaything is to a child. I have mentioned that he early acquired the taste when a boy, his
                        father having one at Warnham pond, a lake of considerable extent, or rather two connected
                        by a draw-bridge, which led to a pleasure-garden and boat-house. He was nineteen when he
                        used to float paper flotillas at Oxford,&#8212;older when he made a sail of a ten-pound
                        note on the Serpentine, and I have no doubt would, with any boy, at twenty-eight, have done
                        the same. The water was his fatal element. He crossed the Channel to Calais in <pb
                            xml:id="II.124"/> an open boat, a rash experiment; when at school, the greatest
                        pleasure he enjoyed was an excursion we made to Richmond from Brentford&#8212;a pleasure
                        perhaps the more sweet, being a stolen one. He descended the Rhine on a sort of raft. He
                        made a voyage in a wherry from Windsor to Crickdale; was nearly lost in coming from the
                        Isle of Man; at Geneva, past days and nights on the lake: and now, reader, excuse this
                        recapitulation, though imperfect,&#8212;behold him on the Serchio. </p>

                        children (they had two), served also to heighten its agreeableness. She was an accomplished
                        and elegant woman, not only a superior player on the harp and guitar, but had a sweet and
                        cultivated voice. <persName>Shelley</persName> was particularly fond of music, and
                        delighted in her simple airs, some of which she had brought with her, in memory, from the

                            <persName key="PeShell1822">Shelley</persName> the demon of despondency, that often lay
                        on him like a nightmare; and in them he found a refuge and shelter from the world that
                        never ceased to be his foe. The cold, censorious, formal, conventional world, often puts
                        interpretations the most unworthy on the friendship between two persons of different sexes;
                        but a purer being than <persName key="JaJohns1884">Mrs. Williams</persName> cannot exist.
                        Not a breath of scandal could possibly attach to her fame. The verses addressed to her
                        always passed through the hands of <persName key="EdWilli1822">Williams</persName> himself,
                        and who had too much con-<pb xml:id="II.128"/>fidence in the virtue of one devotedly his,
                        to harbour for a moment any jealousy of an attachment the most innocent and disinterested.
                        Effusions such as these must not be interpreted literally. Should we allow ourselves to put
                        wrong constructions on such outpourings of the soul, such Platonic aspirations, what are we
                        to say for those of the <persName key="LeLando1838">L. E. L.s</persName>, and <persName

                        and were then at Florence waiting for <persName>Lord Byron</persName> to join them. I say a

                        situation at Ravenna was also far from a pleasant one. A <persName key="JoHobho1869"

                        territories. He says in his journal, &#8220;<q>They mean to insurrect here, and are to

                        founded on his often expressed appreciation of his worth, that she writes to him,

                            my philosophy are put to a severe proof, whilst I refrain from seeking out some obscure

                    <p xml:id="ch26-14"> It was with this foul calumny festering in his soul, that he goes on to

                            our own class, as much as possible in intellect or in feelings. Our roots never struck
                            so deeply as at Pisa, and the transplanted tree flourishes not. The calumnies, the
                            sources of which are deeper than we perceive, have ultimately for object the depriving
                            us of the means of security <pb xml:id="II.134"/> and subsistence. You will easily
                            perceive the gradations by which calumny proceeds to pretext, pretext to persecution,
                            and persecution to the ban of fire and water. It is for this, and not because this or
                            that fool, or the whole universe of fools, curse and rail, that calumny is worth
                            repeating or chastising.</q>&#8221; </p>

                            >Lord Byron</persName> had already arrived, and was settled in the Casa Lanfranchi.
                            <persName key="PeShell1822">Shelley</persName> had taken up his abode on the opposite
                        side of the Lung&#8217; Arno. His apartment, however, looked to the west, and it was
                        basking in the sun when I entered; and I may here add, that during almost all that winter,
                        such is the divine climate of Pisa, we dined with the windows open. At his house, I first
                        saw the <persName key="TeGuicc1873">Countess Guiccioli</persName>, then a strikingly
                        handsome woman. Those who saw her at that time, might have supposed that she had sat to
                            <persName key="Giorg1510">Georgione</persName> for a celebrated picture in the Dresden
                        gallery&#8212;a gentleman with two ladies; she bore such a striking resemblance to one of
                        these, that on the left of the groupe; possessing the same character of features, bright
                        auburn hair and eyes, that seem indigenal to, or hereditary in the fair Venetians. For many
                        weeks she passed her <hi rend="italic">soirees</hi> at Shelley&#8217;s; a more perfectly
                        amiable, interesting, and feminine person I never met. Her at-<pb xml:id="II.141"/>tachment
                        to <persName>Byron</persName>, whose name she pronounced, laying a strong stress on the <hi

                        Italian,) had been her first; she loved him with a devotion of which no women are so
                        capable as the Italians, and has remained constant to that love&#8212;unchanged and
                        unchangeable. I met her many years after, at the baths of Lucca, and at Florence, where at
                        a ball given by the <persName>Prince Borghese</persName>, singularly enough, I, at the
                        request of <persName>Mr. King</persName>, now <persName key="LdLovel1">Lord
                            Lovelace</persName>, introduced her to him; little thinking that he would afterwards

                    <p xml:id="ch27-2"> I found him an altered man; his health had sensibly improved, and he had

                        predilection at Oxford. A friend speaking of several contradictions in his appearance and
                        character at that time, says, &#8220;<q>His ordinary preparations for a rural walk formed a
                            remarkable contrast with his mild aspect and pacific habits. He provided himself with a
                            pair of duelling pistols, and good store of powder and ball, and when he came to a
                            solitary spot, he pinned a card, or fixed some other mark upon a tree or a bank, and
                            amused himself by firing at it. He was a pretty good shot, and was much delighted at
                            his success. The same gentleman says of himself, that having accidentally shot the
                            target in the centre, <persName key="PeShell1822">Shelley</persName> ran to the card,
                            examined it attentively several times, and more than once measured the distance on the
                            spot where I had stood.</q>&#8221; How often have I seen him do the same! I imagine
                        that it was <persName>Shelley</persName>, who at Geneva, inoculated <persName>Lord
                            Byron</persName> (whose <pb xml:id="II.143"/> lameness made his out-door amusements
                        very limited,) with the taste. These trials of skill were
                            <persName>Shelley&#8217;s</persName> favourite recreation, and even the preparations
                        for it occupied his thoughts agreeably, for he generally made and carried to the ground a
                        target to be used on the occasion, and habit enabled him to manufacture them with great
                        neatness. I have often been surprised to see the poet occupied in making circles and
                        bull&#8217;s eyes. <persName>Shelley</persName> used to wonder that
                            <persName>Byron</persName> shot so well, for his aim was long, and his hand trembled.
                            <persName>Shelley&#8217;s</persName> was all firmness. He was a very indifferent
                        horseman&#8212;had an awkward and unsafe seat&#8212;which is very singular, as he had very
                        early been used to ride, though it is probable that he had almost from boyhood discontinued
                        the habit. <persName>Byron&#8217;s</persName> seat was not the best in the world, nor his
                        stud very famous. The animal who carried him was loaded with fat, and resembled, if she
                        were not one, a Flanders mare. She was encumbered with a sliding martingale, a hussar
                        saddle, and holsters with <pb xml:id="II.144"/> pistols; was remarkable for the lowness of
                        her action, and the amble, her usual pace, which, from its ease, made her a favourite with
                        her master. </p>

                        were as different as mind and matter. He possessed two natures&#8212;the human and the
                        divine. I have often heard <persName key="PeShell1822">Shelley</persName>, almost in the
                        language of a gifted German lady-writer, say,&#8212;&#8220;<q>The poet is a different being
                            from the rest of the world. Imagination steals over him&#8212;he knows not whence.
                            Images float before him&#8212;he knows not their home. Struggling and contending powers
                            are engendered within him, which no outward <pb xml:id="II.145"/> impulse, no inward
                            passion awakened. He utters sentiments he never meditated. He creates persons whose
                            original he had never seen; but he cannot command the power that called them out of
                            nothing. He must wait till the God or dæmon genius breathes it into him. He has higher
                            powers than the generality of men, and the most distinguished abilities; but he is
                            possessed by a still higher power. He prescribes laws, he overturns customs and
                            opinions, he begins and ends an epoch, like a God; but he is a blind, obedient,
                            officiating priest in the temple of God.</q>&#8221; <persName>Byron</persName> also was
                        fully indued with this persuasion, for he says,&#8212;&#8220;<q>Poetry is a distinct
                            faculty of the soul, and has no more to do with the every-day individual, than the

                            <persName>Shelley</persName> more fully developes this sentiment, and
                            says,&#8212;&#8220;<q>Poets are the hyerophants of an unapprehended inspiration; the
                            mirrors of the gigantic shadows which futurity casts on the present; the words which
                            express what they understand not; the <pb xml:id="II.146"/> trumpet that sounds to
                            battle, and feels not what it inspires; the influence which is moved, but moves not.
                            Poets are the unacknowledged legislators of the world!</q>&#8221; And
                            again,&#8212;&#8221;<q>They measure the circumference, and sound the depth of human
                            nature with a comprehensive, all-penetrating spirit, at the manifestations of which
                            they are themselves, perhaps, the most sincerely astonished,&#8212;for it is less <hi

                    <p xml:id="ch27-5"> But speaking of <persName key="LdByron">Byron</persName> in his human
                        capacity. The <persName>Byron</persName> of England and Geneva, and the
                            <persName>Byron</persName> of Italy, or at least Pisa, were widely different persons.
                        His talk was, at that time, a dilution of his letters, full of <hi rend="italic"
                            >persiflage</hi> and <foreign><hi rend="italic">calembourg</hi></foreign>. <persName
                            key="PeShell1822">Shelley</persName> used to compare him to <persName key="FrVolta1778"
                            >Voltaire</persName>, to whom he would have thought it the greatest compliment to be
                        compared; for if there was any one writer whom he admired more than another, it was the
                        author of <name type="title" key="FrVolta1778.Candide">Candide</name>, Like
                            <persName>Voltaire</persName>, he looked upon converse as a relaxation, not an exercise
                        of mind. Both professed the same speculative&#8212;I might say, sceptical turn of mind; the
                            <pb xml:id="II.147"/> same power of changing the subject from the grave to the gay; the
                        same mastery over the sublime, the pathetic, the comic. No, he differed from the
                        philosopher of Ferney in one respect,&#8212;he never scoffed at religion. His boss of
                        veneration was strongly developed, and had he returned to England, he would, I have little
                        doubt, have died, as <persName key="LdRoche2">Rochester</persName> did, and as <persName
                            key="ThMoore1852">Tommy Moore</persName> lives, in the odour of sanctity. </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch27-6">
                        <persName key="PeShell1822">Shelley</persName> frequently lamented that it was almost
                        impossible to keep <persName key="LdByron">Byron</persName> to any one given point. He flew
                        about from subject to subject like a will-o&#8217;-the-wisp, touching them with a false
                        fire, without throwing any real or steady light on any. There was something enchanting in
                        his manner, his voice, his smile&#8212;a fascination in them; but on leaving him, I have
                        often marvelled that I gained so little from him worth carrying away; whilst every word of
                            <persName>Shelley&#8217;s</persName> was almost oracular; his reasoning subtle and
                        profound; his opinions, whatever they were, sincere and undisguised; whilst with
                            <persName>Byron</persName>, such was his love of mystification, it was impossible to
                        know <pb xml:id="II.148"/> when he was in earnest. As in the writings of the Greek
                        philosophers, there was always an undercurrent. He dealt, too, in the gross and indelicate,
                        of which <persName>Shelley</persName> had an utter abhorrence, and often left him with
                        ill-disguised disgust. At times, however, but they only, like angels&#8217; visits, few and
                        far between, he, as was said of <persName key="RaSanzi1520">Raphael</persName>, could pass
                        from the greatest jesting to the greatest seriousness with the most charming grace. To get
                        him into an argument was a very difficult matter. <persName key="ThHogg1862">Mr.
                            Hogg</persName>, speaking of <persName>Shelley</persName>, says,&#8212;&#8220;<q>Never
                            was there a more unexceptionable disputant. He was the only arguer I ever knew, who
                            drew every argument from the nature of the thing, and who could never be provoked to
                            descend to personal contentions. He was free from the weaknesses of our
                            nature&#8212;conceit, irritability, vanity, and impatience of contradiction.</q>&#8221; </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch27-7"> &#8220;<q>The Eternal Child!</q>&#8221; this beautiful expression, so true
                        in its application to <persName key="PeShell1822">Shelley</persName>! I borrow from
                            <persName key="GeGilfi1878">Mr. Gilfillan</persName>, and I am tempted to add the rest

                        <pb xml:id="II.149"/> and <persName key="LdByron">Lord Byron</persName>, as far as it
                        relates to their external appearance. In the forehead and head of
                            <persName>Byron</persName> there was a more massive power and breadth:
                            <persName>Shelley&#8217;s</persName> had a smooth, arched, spiritual expression;
                        wrinkles there seemed none on his brow; it was as if perpetual youth had there dropped its
                        freshness. <persName>Byron&#8217;s</persName> eye seemed the focus of pride and lust;
                            <persName>Shelley&#8217;s</persName> was mild, pensive, fixed on you, but seeing
                        through the mist of its own idealism. Defiance curled <persName>Byron&#8217;s</persName>
                        nostril, and sensuality steeped his full, large lips; the lower portions of
                            <persName>Shelley&#8217;s</persName> face were frail, feminine, and flexible.
                            <persName>Byron&#8217;s</persName> head was turned upwards; as if, having proudly risen
                        above his contemporaries, he were daring to claim kindred, or to demand a contest with a
                        superior order of beings; <persName>Shelley&#8217;s</persName> was half bent in reverence
                        and humility before some vast vision seen by his eye alone. In the portrait of
                            <persName>Byron</persName>, taken at the age of nineteen, you see the unnatural age of
                        premature passion. His hair is grey, his dress is youthful, but his face is old. <pb
                            xml:id="II.150"/> In <persName>Shelley</persName> you see the eternal child, none the
                        less because the hair is grey, and that &#8220;<q>sorrow seems half his
                        immortality.</q>&#8221; </p>

                        indeed, the tone of <name type="title" key="LdByron.Cain">Cain&#8217;s</name> language was
                        emphatically Byronic,&#8212;I have reason to think that <persName>Byron</persName> owes to
                            <persName>Shelley</persName> the platonic idea of the Hades,&#8212;the preadamite
                        worlds, and their phantasmal shapes, perhaps suggested by <persName key="Lucia180"

                        Transformed</name>&#8221; was placed in his <pb xml:id="II.153"/> hands,&#8212;and
                            <persName>Shelley&#8217;s</persName> remarks after perusing it,&#8212;&#8220;<q>that he
                            liked it the least of all his works; that it smelt too strongly of <name type="title"
                                key="JoGoeth1832.Faust">Faust</name>; and besides, that there were two lines in it,
                            word for word from <persName key="RoSouth1843">Southey</persName>.</q>&#8221; On which
                        occasion <persName>Byron</persName> turned deadly pale, seized the MS., and committed it to
                        the flames, seeming to take a savage delight in seeing it consume. But it was destined to
                        rise again from its ashes. Poets, like mothers, have a strange fondness for their ricketty
                        offspring. <persName>Byron</persName> thought that all his writings were equally good, and
                        always vindicated strenuously those which were the least popular, particularly in the case
                        of the <name type="title" key="LdByron.Morgante">Version from Pulci</name>, which
                            <persName>Mr. Moore</persName> says &#8220;<q>must be fated to be unread;</q>&#8221;
                        not that the version itself was bad,&#8212;on the contrary, it was most faithful; but the
                        poem was not worth translating, and is totally at variance with the taste of the English
                        public. My notion is, that <persName>Lord Byron&#8217;s</persName> object was to shew the
                        inferiority of the original, considered the best of the productions of the Italian <pb
                            xml:id="II.154"/> weavers of merry octava rima, to <name type="title"

                        entered the lists against a dead man) being at all aware that the <name type="title"

                        less that it was framed and modelled after the <name type="title"

                            &#8220;<q>that he is so jealous of being indebted to any one for a hint, that he was

                            he bestows on the pseudonimous author, when he asks, &#8216;<q>who the <hi

                            contained, being in accordance with the mystification he wished to keep up.</q>&#8221;
                            <persName>Leigh Hunt</persName> goes on to say,&#8212;&#8220;<q>that it is utter <pb

                            weavers of merry octava rima.</q>&#8221; <persName>Shelley</persName> seems to have
                        been of the same opinion, and during his visits to Ravenna, speaking of <name type="title"
                            >Don Juan</name>, says,&#8212;&#8220;<q><persName>Byron</persName> has read to me one
                            of his unpublished cantos of <name type="title">Don Juan</name>, which is astonishingly
                            fine. It sets him not only above, but far above all the poets of the age. Every word is
                            stamped with immortality. I despair of rivalling <persName>Lord Byron</persName>, and
                            well I may; and there is no other with whom it is worth contending. The canto is in the
                            style, but totally, and sustained with considerable ease and power, like the end of the
                            second canto. There is not a word which the most rigid assertor of the dignity of human
                            nature would desire to be cancelled; it fulfils in a certain measure what I have long
                            preached of producing, something wholly new, and relative to the age, and yet
                            surpassingly beautiful; it may be vanity, but I think I see the traces of my earnest
                            exhortations to him to create something new!</q>&#8221; </p>

                        from classical authors, will be found most powerful. We certainly do marvel that this

                        and it is a striking ignorance of the best critics. The sources whence he drew the

                            <persName>Casti</persName> could possibly have suggested the idea. Moreover, in the

                            >Charles the First</name>. He had designed to write a tragedy on this ungrateful
                        subject as far back as 1818, and had begun it at the end of the following year, when he
                        asked me to obtain for him that well-known pamphlet, which was in my father&#8217;s
                            library,&#8212;&#8220;<name type="title" key="KillingNoe">Killing no
                        murder</name>.&#8221; He was, however, <foreign><hi rend="italic">in limine</hi></foreign>
                        diverted at that time to more attractive subjects, and now resumed his abandoned labours,
                        of which he has left a very unsatisfactory, though valuable Bozzo. The task seemed to him
                        an irksome one. His progress was slow; <pb xml:id="II.163"/> one day he expunged what he
                        had written the day before. He occasionally shewed and read to me his MS., which was lined
                        and interlined and interworded, so as to render it almost illegible. The scenes were
                        disconnected, and intended to be interwoven in the tissue of the drama. He did not thus
                        compose the <name type="title" key="PeShell1822.Cenci">Cenci</name>. He seemed tangled in
                        an inextricable web of difficulties, as to the treatment of his subject; and it was clear
                        that he had formed no definite plan in his own mind, how to connect the links of the
                        complicated yarn of events that led to that frightful catastrophe, or to justify it. There
                        is in the Uffizzii gallery, at Florence, an unfinished bust by <persName key="MiBuona1564"
                            >Michael Angelo</persName>, of <persName key="MaBrutu">Brutus</persName>, on which is
                        written an epigram, the point of which is, that the great sculptor wisely abstained from
                        the task from disgust at the traitor; might not similar influences have raised an obstacle
                        in the mind of <persName key="PeShell1822">Shelley</persName>, to the completion of his

                            into a line more matter than can be included in German, Italian, or French. The
                            Portuguese is perhaps an exception, as you found in the vain attempt of putting the

                            sonorous, though it does not admit of so many poetical licences as the Italian, and is

                            endure. For rendering Greek it is unapproachable, admitting of a coinage of compound
                            words on which we cannot venture,&#8212;that would be hostile to the spirit of our

                        often discussed the Greek revolution, and he was enthusiastic in his aspirations for her
                        liberty. He would not believe but that the picture drawn by <persName key="ThHope1831">Mr.
                            Hope</persName> in his <name type="title" key="ThHope1831.Anastasius"
                        >Anastasius</name>, of the modern Greeks, was an overcharged one; though he admitted that a
                        long course of political slavery under their Mahomedan masters, had so demoralised and
                        bastardised the nation, that important changes must be undergone before it could be
                        regenerated; but of this he entertained no fears. The opening Chorus of <name type="title"
                            >Hellas</name> is taken from the &#8220;<name type="title" key="PeCalde1681.Príncipe"

                        add, the most beautiful. The Chorusses are wonderfully imaginative, and melodious in their
                        versification, and splendidly exemplify his peculiarity of style. Whether <persName

                            <persName key="LdByron">Byron&#8217;s</persName> strain; and the prophecy is such as
                        poets love to dwell upon, and <persName key="PeShell1822">Shelley</persName> most of
                        all,&#8212;the regeneration of mankind, though clouded with the melancholy foreboding of
                        the horrors that the struggle must cost. It is impossible to tell how much this drama, and
                        the enthusiasm of <persName>Shelley</persName>, influenced the determination of
                            <persName>Byron</persName> to devote his energies to the sacred cause. If he was to
                        have died young, he could not have died at a better moment for his fame. Nothing, however,
                        in 1821 and the beginning of 1822, was further from my thoughts, than that he would have
                        taken any part in the struggle. He out-anastasiused <name type="title"
                            key="ThHope1831.Anastasius">Anastasius</name> in his view of the Greek character. He
                        used to <pb xml:id="II.185"/> say, &#8220;<q>that the Greeks were so fallen, that it would
                            be a vain attempt to raise them. One might as well hope to re-animate a
                        corpse.</q>&#8221; Words that had no sincerity in them, for perhaps at that very time, he
                        had decided in his own mind to join their cause, which, if he thought so desperate and
                        unworthy, he would never have done, nor have embarked in it so large a portion of his
                        fortune; not that he risked indeed the money, for it was raised on the security of the
                        Greek Loan, (friend <persName key="JoHobho1869">Hobhouse</persName> satisfying him of the
                        validity of the security,) and was in fact repaid before his death. In
                            <persName>Byron</persName>, were, as I have said, two natures,&#8212;the man and the
                        poet were different entities. This incongruity between his poetical sentiments and his
                        prose ones, was very remarkable. In the case of the Greeks, the former prevailed.
                            <persName>Shelley</persName> used to say that &#8220;<q>on this subject, or any other,
                            it was not easy to see his mind through the mists he delighted to throw around
                        it.</q>&#8221; No one mystified so much,&#8212;indeed it was impossible to know when <pb
                            xml:id="II.186"/> he was in jest or in earnest. If he mystified
                            <persName>Shelley</persName>, no wonder that he should often have mystified me in our

                            would be in it a bequest of ten thousand pounds to <persName>Madame
                                G&#8212;&#8212;</persName>, (<persName key="TeGuicc1873"
                        >Guiccioli</persName>).</q>&#8221; (He mentioned this circumstance also to <persName
                            key="LyBless1">Lady Blessington</persName>.) &#8220;<q>When the news of his death
                            reached me, I took it for granted that this will <pb xml:id="II.187"/> would be found
                            among his sealed papers, he had left me; but there was no such instrument.</q>&#8221;
                        Now he had never intended to leave his will with <persName>Mr. Moore</persName>, nor to
                        make any such bequest, any more than he meant (as he told me) to leave his daughters joint
                        heiresses; for <persName key="AdByron1852">Ada</persName> he disinherited in favour of his
                            <persName key="AuLeigh1851">sister</persName>, and to <persName key="AlByron1822"
                            >Allegra</persName> he left five thousand pounds, saddled with a proviso, that it
                        should be cancelled if she married a foreigner. The next instance I shall adduce of
                        mystification, is the passage in his journal (alias autobiography,) where he wishes to have
                        it believed that the <name type="title" key="LdByron.Corsair">Corsair</name> and himself
                        were one and the same personage, saying,&#8212;&#8220;<q>Who knows what I was doing in the
                            East?</q>&#8221; &amp;c. The third is his mystification respecting his contemporaries,
                            <persName key="SaRoger1855">Rogers</persName>, <persName key="ThCampb1844"
                            >Campbell</persName>, and <persName>Moore</persName>, and the high place he allots them
                        in the literary world. As over-politeness is rudeness, so over-flattery is dispraise, and
                        over-disparagement of self, excess of vanity. <persName>Shelley</persName> was always
                        indignant at the high rank he assigned to <persName>Camp-<pb xml:id="II.188"/>
                            bell</persName> and <persName>Rogers</persName>; a rank he has put on record by a
                        diagram or triangular gradus ad Parnassum; and again in another place, where after
                            <persName key="WaScott">Walter Scott</persName>, he says, &#8220;<q>I should place
                                <persName>Rogers</persName> next in the list. I value more the man as <hi

                        paid <persName>Campbell</persName> a visit at his request, and instead of discussing the
                        prospects and hopes of Italy, he could talk of nothing but

                            young ladies.</q>&#8221; In that dialogue he throws off the mask, and shows his real
                        opinion of the head and heart of &#8220;<q>The Beau, Bard, and Banker;</q>&#8221; whose
                        dinners and coteries had begun to fade from his memory by time and distance, and the

                        he placed under the cushion of the sofa where he intended to seat, and did seat him, and
                        during the colloquy, enjoyed the secret pleasure of seeing &#8220;The Banker-Bard&#8221;
                        repose in unconscious security on his own literary rocket, which <persName>Byron</persName>

                        occasion of the parting dinner given to him (<persName>Moore</persName>,) on the occasion
                        of his quitting Paris, when he refused to reply to <persName key="GoWebst1836">Sir Godfrey

                        that after <persName>Byron&#8217;s</persName> death, he flitted about London like an

                        not seem to appreciate very highly <persName>Shelley&#8217;s</persName> poetry, which he
                        calls &#8220;<q>a rich and glittering labyrinth;</q>&#8221; and gives him credit only for
                            &#8220;<q>an exuberant fancy,</q>&#8221; which he says, &#8220;<q>was the medium
                            through which he saw all things, his facts as well as his theories; and that not only
                            the greater part of his poetry, but the political and philosophical speculations in
                            which he indulged, were all distilled through the same over-fining and unrealising
                            alembic.</q>&#8221; </p>

                        without his having seen them, or at least the greater part of them?

                        told me that, in his opinion, my proposed way of settling literary disputes was a bad one,
                        and requested to see the reviews, and my MS. journal. Having convinced him from the perusal
                        of the latter, that every word in the <name type="title" key="ThMedwi1869.Conversations"
                            >Conversations</name> had been copied from my daily notes, I next proceeded to show him
                        that <persName>Hobhouse&#8217;s</persName> allegations were for the most part so many
                        intentional falsehoods, and, at his advice, wrote a pamphlet, which, when finished, I
                        handed to the great prose writer, who was so kind as to correct it, and add thereto many
                        passages, one of which was,&#8212;the style indeed is unmistakable, that beginning,
                            &#8220;<q>Hobhouse is known of old as a heavy hand,</q>&#8221; &amp;c.

                        desire, withdrew it. <persName>Hobhouse</persName> says I suppressed it. Suppression means
                        something published&#8212;and no one understands the sense of the word better than
                            <persName>Hobhouse</persName>&#8212;for he acted thus with his <name type="title"

                        published, but never shown, with my consent, to a single individual. One reason for my
                        withholding it from the world was, that although in more than <hi rend="italic">thirty</hi>
                        instances it contained evidence of malignant and intentional lying on the part of the said
                            <persName>Hobhouse</persName>, there still remained several mystifications
                        irreconcilable, but with <persName key="LdByron">Lord Byron&#8217;s</persName> since-proved
                        habit of drawing the long bow. Another reason was, that I considered it a matter of perfect
                        indifference to me whether aught contained in the <name type="title">Conversations</name>
                        was true or false&#8212;sufficient for me that it came from <persName>Lord Byron</persName>
                        himself. Not one tittle have I altered, or ever intend to blot out of &#8220;<name
                            type="title">The Conversations</name>,&#8221;&#8212;not even the imaginary duel

                        other figments. Whether, also, <persName key="JoMurra1843">Murray</persName> was justly or
                        unjustly attacked, can be nothing to me. That bibliopole I had never seen, and had not the

                        malignant enough to invent these things against him. I had been passing many years in

                        the day. One blunder I made is certainly ludicrous, and excites a smile at my expense. I

                        the cathedral is much indebted to him for its judicious improvements and restorations.

                        mean to affirm. It might be held sufficient ground to relieve him from his sub-preceptorial
                        duties, that he had published <persName key="LdSurre">Surrey&#8217;s</persName> amatory

                            the man who had a name that could be punned upon;</q>&#8221; and when he heard of what
                        I am about to detail, said, &#8220;that the preacher read some of the commandments
                        affirmatively and not negatively, as Thou &#8220;<q>shalt Nott! (not) bear false witness
                            against thy neighbour, &amp;c.</q>&#8221; The circumstance to which I allude, and that
                        excited <persName>Lord Byron&#8217;s</persName> bile, is this: He opened a chapel in his
                        own apartment, and preached a trilogy of sermons against Atheism, <persName
                            key="MaShell1851">Mrs. Shelley</persName> forming one of the congregation, and his eyes
                        being directed on her with a significant expression, and as his whole flock did not consist
                        of more than fourteen or fifteen, it was evident the Doctor was preaching <hi rend="italic"
                            >at</hi>, and not <hi rend="italic">to</hi> some of it. These discourses came to
                            <persName>Byron&#8217;s</persName> ears, and though <persName>Shelley</persName>
                        laughed at the malice of the Doctor, the noble bard was indignant at the prostitution of
                        his pulpit, and still more so when he heard that the divine had at <persName
                            key="EmBeauc1832">Mrs. Beauclerc&#8217;s</persName> called <persName>Shelley</persName>
                        a &#8220;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Scelerato</hi></foreign>,&#8221; which no doubt was
                        deemed very <pb xml:id="II.223"/> witty. The day after, <persName>Byron</persName> wrote a

                        must be confessed, as I have already stated, that <persName key="PeShell1822"
                            >Shelley</persName> was but little affected by his preaching; but his hatred and horror
                        of fanaticism shewed itself a short time after, on an occasion that soon occurred to awaken
                        all his sympathies. One day when I called at the bookseller
                            <persName>Moloni&#8217;s</persName>, I heard a report that a subject of Lucca had been
                        condemned to be burnt alive for sacrilege. A priest who shortly after entered, confirmed
                        the news, and expressed himself in the following terms:&#8212;&#8220;<q>Wretch!</q>&#8221;
                        said he, &#8220;<q>he took the consecrated wafers from the altar, and threw them
                            contemptuously about the church. No tortures can be great enough for such a horrible
                            crime; burning is too light a death. I will go to Lucca, I would go to Spain to see the

                            <hi rend="italic">charitable</hi> feelings of a follower of Christ. I left him with

                                    true, I dare say; and it might, and it may be of personal inconvenience to us.
                                    But that does not appear to me to be a reason to allow a being to be burnt,
                                    without trying to save him,&#8212;to save him by any means; but remonstrance is
                                    of course out of the question, but I do not see how a temperate remonstrance

                                        Duke</persName> personally, and might perhaps prevail on him to interfere.
                                    But as he goes to-morrow, you must be quick, or it will be useless. Make any
                                    use of my name you please. </p>

                        to be acquainted, and I was requested by both to be the medium of introduction, during a
                        ride, in which they were, to save formality, to meet as by accident. <persName
                            key="LyBless1">Lady Blessington</persName> has mentioned
                            <persName>Byron&#8217;s</persName> superstition as to days, and I have said that he
                        objected to a <pb xml:id="II.234"/> Friday as that of the meeting. But, notwithstanding, it
                        was fated that this introduction should not be attended with any harmonious results.
                            <persName>Byron</persName>, after it, called, but was not let in. He thought himself
                        slighted, and took her not &#8220;being at home&#8221; as a mortal affront, and would
                        accept no after-excuses. A correspondence ensued between them, which I applied to her for,
                        but she did not wish to have it published. Her apologies failed to soothe the Poet&#8217;s
                                <foreign><hi rend="italic">amour propre</hi></foreign>, and he was inexorable. On
                        the occasion of her eldest daughter&#8217;s birth-day, she had invited <persName
                            key="GiRosin1855">Professor Rosini</persName>, who on the evening of the fête, sent the
                        following lines as an excuse, which that lady deemed a very ambiguous compliment, and
                        referred them to <persName>Shelley</persName> and <persName>Lord Byron</persName>, who both
                        thought they could not have been intended as an affront. I give the verses and a

                        to an exile, of his age, from his own country, which none love so ardently as the Italians.
                        The passion of the younger <persName>Foscoli</persName> for Venice is by no means
                        overcharged. <persName>Pietro</persName> was, as <persName key="LyBless1">Lady
                            Blessington</persName> says, an amiable man, and was adored by his sister. The last
                        time I saw him was at Genoa, shortly after <persName>Shelley&#8217;s</persName> death,
                        whither he had preceded <persName key="LdByron">Lord Byron</persName>, having been sent out
                        of Tuscany, for some affray with one of the noble lord&#8217;s retainers; and I may here
                        add that he afterwards accompanied him to Greece, and brought home
                            <persName>Byron&#8217;s</persName> remains; on which occasion <persName

                        agreeable, and carried with him the passport of a very handsome person. There was also at
                        Pisa this winter, a <persName key="KaLutze1864">Baron Lutzerode</persName>, one of the
                        chamberlains of one of the Princes of Saxe, then on a visit to the <persName

                            <persName>Byron</persName> gave an impression of a sentimental seal and his autograph,
                        was not unfrequently at <persName>Shelley&#8217;s</persName>. He would be a poet, and had
                        written a poem entitled &#8220;<name type="title">The Swan Song of the
                            Priest-Murderer</name>,&#8221; which he wished <persName>Shelley</persName> much to
                        translate, and which, with his good nature and love of obliging, he one day did attempt,
                        but found the task not to be accomplished. <persName>Shelley</persName> used to laugh
                        heartily at the strange title. </p>

                        have said, most abstemious in his diet,&#8212;utterly indifferent to the luxuries of the
                        table, and, although he had been obliged for his health to discontinue his Pythagorean
                        system, he still almost lived on bread, fruit, and vegetables. Wine, like <persName
                            key="WiHazli1830">Hazlitt</persName>, he never touched with his lips;
                            <persName>Hazlitt</persName> had abandoned it from a vow, having once injured his

                        exciting for his brain. He was essentially a water-drinker, and his choice of Pisa, and his
                        continuance there, had been, and were directed, as I have said, by its purity,&#8212;the

                            <persName>Shelley</persName> was a man of the nicest habits,&#8212;the most scrupulous
                        nicety in his person; invariably, whatever might be his occupation, making his toilette for
                        dinner, during the interval between which he wrote his letters on his knees. His
                        correspondents, as may be seen by the second volume of his <name type="title"
                            key="PeShell1822.Essays">Prose Works</name>, were not numerous. His pen flowed on with
                        extraordinary rapidity on these occasions, and without a moment&#8217;s pause, his mind was
                        mirrored on the paper&#8212;and beautiful, indeed, was his epistolary style, nor less bold
                        and beautiful his hand-writing, which is said by some to be a distinguishing mark of
                        character. His hand was very early formed, and never altered,&#8212;as will appear by the

                        At other times, he would read what <persName key="MaShell1851">Mrs. Shelley</persName> had

                        the Court of Florence, the duchess spoke of her to me in the kindest terms, and of
                            <persName key="PeShell1822">Shelley</persName>, with whose writings she seemed
                        familiar, and said she thought him unjustly calumniated, for he had left behind him at Pisa
                        the memory of his virtues and benevolence. To <persName>Byron</persName> the duchess made
                        no allusion. She remembered the affair of <persName key="StMasi1822">Sergeant-major

                        happening to turn on longevity, <persName>Byron</persName> offered

                            <persName>Shelley</persName> would have refused to receive the money, but it ought to
                        have been proffered; and I have little doubt that had the baronet died the first,
                            <persName>Shelley</persName> would have acted differently. That

                        too little. The new accusation came strangely enough (it did come through <persName

                            <persName>Lord Byron</persName> says, in another of his letters, &#8220;<q>that he had

                        not only reckless of his own reputation&#8212;of what the world thought of him&#8212;but
                        equally regardless of what he thought of others, that he, whose favourite dogma was

                            <persName>Byron</persName> delighted in the idea, that these memoirs, written expressly
                        for publication after his death, would make the world stare, and set everybody by the ears.

                        three weeks in transcribing. The subjects he discussed were mostly new to me, who had
                        passed some years abroad. The persons of whom he spoke, totally unknown to me; and it is

                            key="PeShell1822">Shelley</persName>, whom he consulted in all his private affairs,

                        contributed also to foster the passion, and being acquainted with <persName

                        him on the subject, and the consequence was, that a schooner, but on a much smaller scale,
                        was ordered. The shape of the boat, modelled after one of the man-of-war boats in the
                        dock-yard, with some variations in the build, was at length approved of. Her dimensions
                        were to be twenty-four feet long, eight broad, and drawing four feet of water. She was a
                        beautiful craft on paper, but to my mind far from safe, for her ballast, two tons of lead,
                        was to be let into her keel. Any one acquainted with boating, must know that the only good
                        ballast is live ballast, as it is called,&#8212;water casks, that can be shifted starboard
                        or larboard, according to the reeling of the vessel, and which, <pb xml:id="II.257"/> in
                        cases of emergency, can be thrown overboard to lighten her; a ballast indeed that scarcely
                        requires this, for it will float. I need not enlarge on this topic, but how far my
                        criticism was justified by the event, will soon appear. </p>

                        wounds. This story, though I did not credit it, greatly annoyed me, and I immediately wrote
                        to <persName>Lord Byron</persName> for the particulars, in order that I might contradict it

                            susceptible. I never perfectly understood the Hartz mountain scene until I saw the

                            which made my brain swim round, only to touch the leaf on the opposite side of which I

                                >Williams</persName> should go to Leghorn in the boat. Strange that no fear of
                            danger crossed our minds. Living on the sea-shore, the ocean became a plaything; as a
                            child may play with a lighted stick, till a spark enflames a forest, and spreads
                            destruction over all, so did we fearlessly and blindly tamper with danger, and make a

                            the line of coast to Leghorn, gave no more notion of peril, than a fair-weather inland

                            Shelley</persName>, &#8220;<q>came over my mind, when they went. During the whole of
                            our stay at Lerici, an intense presentiment of coming evil brooded over my mind, and
                            covered this beautiful place, and genial summer, with the shadow of coming misery. I
                            had vainly struggled with these emotions&#8212;they seemed accounted for by my illness;
                            but at this hour of separation, they recurred with renewed violence. I did not
                            anticipate danger from them, but a vague expectation of evil shook me to agony, and I
                            could scarcely bring myself to let them go. The day was calm and clear, and a breeze
                            rising at twelve o&#8217;clock, they weighed for Leghorn. They made the run in seven
                            hours and a half. I have heard that <persName key="PeShell1822">Shelley</persName> all
                            the time was in brilliant spirits. Not long before, talking of presentiments, he had
                            said the only one he had ever found infallible, was the certain event of some evil
                            fortune when he felt particularly joyous. <pb xml:id="II.273"/> Yet if ever fate
                            whispered of coming disasters, such inaudible, but not unfelt prognostics hovered
                            around us. The beauty of the place seemed unearthly in its excess; the distance we were
                            from all signs of civilisation, the sea at our feet, its murmurs and its roaring ever
                            in our ears, all these things led the mind to brood over strange things, and lifting it
                            from every-day life, caused it to be familiar with the unreal!</q>&#8221; </p>

                            more popular writers, or because he might feel shackled in the free expression of his
                            opinions, if any friends were to be compromised. By those opinions, carried even to
                            their utmost extent, he wished to live and die, as being in his conviction not only
                            true, but such as would conduce to the moral improvement and happiness of

                    <p xml:id="ch32-1"> The weather, which had been for some days calm and sultry, all at once
                        changed from a Sirocco to a Mistral, but <persName key="PeShell1822">Shelley</persName>,
                        who had no dread of <pb xml:id="II.278"/> his favourite element, and was anxious to return
                        to those he loved, was not to be deterred from his purpose. The sky indeed bore so
                        unpropitious an aspect, that he had been advised to put off his departure, at least till
                        the <name type="ship">Bolivar</name> could be got under weigh, to convoy them. His
                        eagerness, however, admitted of no delay, and with a fair but faint wind, they hoisted all
                        sail, and left the port,&#8212;an English boy added to the boat&#8217;s crew, by name
                            <persName key="ChVivia1822">Charles Vivian</persName>. </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch32-2"> It is a strange coincidence, that I should have been exposed to the same
                        squall, which proved fatal to two of my oldest and best friends. I embarked on the 5th day
                        of July with a party with whom I was acquainted, on board a merchant vessel we had hired at
                        Naples for the voyage to Genoa; during the first two days, we had very light winds, lying
                        becalmed one whole night off the Pontine Marshes, where some of our passengers were
                        attacked with malaria, but which, though sleeping on deck in my cloak, I escaped. On the
                        fourth day, the tail of the Sirocco brought us <pb xml:id="II.279"/> into the gulf of
                        Genoa. That gulf is subject in the summer and autumn, to violent gusts of wind, and our
                        captain, an experienced sailor, as the breeze died away, foresaw that we should not get
                        into port that night. The appearance of the sky was very threatening. Over the Apennines,
                        which encircle Genoa as with an amphitheatre, hung masses on masses up-piled, like those I
                        have seen after the explosion of a mine, of dark clouds, which seemed to confirm his
                        opinion. The squall at length came, the precise time of which I forgot, but it was in the
                        afternoon; and neither in the bay of Biscay, or Bengal, nor between the Tropics, nor on the
                        Line, did I ever witness a severer one; and being accompanied by a heavy rain, it was the
                        more felt. We had, however, close-reefed, and were all snug and in comparatively smooth
                        water, in consequence of the squall blowing right off the shore. We must have been five or
                        six miles from the bay of Spezzia when it burst on us. As I stood with the glass upon deck,
                        only one sail was visible to leeward; its rig differed <pb xml:id="II.280"/> from the
                        ordinary one of the Mediterranean, the <hi rend="italic">latine</hi>, and from the
                        whiteness of her canvas, and build, we took her for an English pleasure-boat. She was
                        hugging the wind with a press of sail, and our skipper observed, that she would soon have
                        it. As he spoke, a fierce gust drove furiously along, blackening the water, and soon
                        enfolded the small craft in its misty arms; or in <persName key="PeShell1822"
                            >Shelley&#8217;s</persName> own words,&#8212; <q>

                        <persName key="DaRober1858">Captain Roberts&#8217;s</persName> account tallies with this.
                        He watched from the lighthouse of Leghorn, with a glass, the vessel in its homeward track;
                        they were off Via Reggio, at some distance from shore, when a storm was driven over the
                        sea. It enveloped this and several larger vessels in darkness. When the cloud passed
                        onwards, <persName>Roberts</persName>
                        <pb xml:id="II.281"/> looked again, and saw every other vessel sailing on the ocean, except
                        this little schooner, which had vanished. </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch32-4"> Little did I suppose, though I had heard from <persName key="PeShell1822"
                            >Shelley</persName> and <persName key="EdWilli1822">Williams</persName> at Naples, that
                        they had received the boat, and were settled at Villa Magni; that this schooner, which
                        disappeared, was <persName>Shelley&#8217;s</persName>. That she should have carried so much
                        canvas, for her gaff-topsails were set, might be considered unsailor-like; but it must be
                        remembered, that the coast is very shallow, and full of reefs, which stretch out a
                        considerable distance from land, and that it was necessary to carry all sail in order to
                        keep clear of the surf, that rises very high along the coast. The only chance of their
                        safety would have been to tack or wear, and drive before the wind, and return to Leghorn.
                        But this idea probably never entered into <persName>Shelley&#8217;s</persName> or
                            <persName>Williams&#8217;s</persName> mind, and from my knowledge of both their
                        characters, they would, I am sure, have incurred any risk rather than have given up the
                        voyage. Perhaps they were insenisble to the danger till it was too late. </p>

                    <pb xml:id="II.282"/>

                    <p xml:id="ch32-5"> After tacking about all night, and the best part of the next day, we at
                        length beat into the harbour of Genoa. There was a rumour at the Hotel de l&#8217;Europe,
                        that an English schooner had been lost, and two Englishmen drowned in the gale near Lerici,
                        but it never struck me that this schooner was <persName key="PeShell1822"
                            >Shelley&#8217;s</persName>, and that he and <persName key="EdWilli1822"
                            >Williams</persName> were the individuals; and after writing to them at the Villa
                        Magni, I proceeded on my journey to Geneva. There, many days after my arrival, I heard from
                            <persName key="MaShell1851">Mrs. Shelley</persName> the melancholy news of her
                        irreparable loss, and without delay recrossed the Alps. At Spezzia the people of the place
                        told me where the bodies of my friends had been cast on shore: they had been thrown on the
                        beach, not together, but several miles apart, and the English boy&#8217;s five miles from
                        that of <persName>Shelley</persName>. The following verses, written in his eighteenth year,
                        recurred to me, which seem entirely out of place where they stand, and as poets sometimes
                        have been inspired by a sort of second-sight, were prophetic that the ocean would be his

                    <p xml:id="ch32-6"> I arrived at Pisa some hours later than I could have wished, for <persName

                        funeral pyre has been so much misrepresented, that I shall premise it with a few
                        observations. Fourteen days elapsed between the loss of the schooner and the finding of the
                        corpses of my friends, and neither of them were in a state to be removed to consecrated
                        ground; but an obstacle to such removal under any circumstances, was, that by the
                        quarantine laws, their friends were not permitted to have possession of their relics. The
                        laws with respect to everything <pb xml:id="II.284"/> cast on land by the sea, being, that
                        it must be burned, in order to prevent the possibility of any remnant bringing the plague

                    <p xml:id="ch32-7"> A consultation took place between <persName key="LdByron">Byron</persName>,

                            >Trelawney</persName>, on this subject. It had not only been the oft-repeated wish of
                            <persName key="PeShell1822">Shelley</persName> to be buried at Rome, and there rejoin
                        his favourite child <persName key="WiShell1819">William</persName>, who lay there, but he
                        had left it as a sacred charge to <persName>Lord Byron</persName>, whom he had appointed as
                        executor to his will, to fulfil this office of friendship for him. Even had the state of
                            <persName>Shelley&#8217;s</persName> corse admitted of being transported to Rome, they

                            <persName key="MaShell1851">Mrs. Shelley</persName> to receive the ashes, after they
                        had been consumed. I say, I arrived at Pisa too late. True to his engagement,
                            <persName>Byron</persName> and his friends had gone that day to perform the singular
                        and pious duty of watching his funeral <pb xml:id="II.285"/> pyre, in order that the ashes
                        might be sent to the English cemetery at Rome. They came to a spot marked by an old
                        withered pine-tree, and near it, on the beach, stood a solitary ruined hut, covered with
                        thatch. The place was well chosen for a poet&#8217;s grave. Some few weeks before, I had
                        ridden with <persName>Shelley</persName> and <persName>Byron</persName> to the very spot,
                        which I have since visited in sad pilgrimage. Before them lay a wide expanse of the blue
                        Mediterannean, with the islands of Elba and Gorgona visible in front; <persName>Lord
                            Byron&#8217;s</persName> yacht, the <name type="ship">Bolivar</name>, riding at anchor
                        at some distance in the offing. On the other side appeared an almost illimitable sandy
                        wilderness, and uninhabitable, only broken here and there by some stunted shrubs, twisted
                        by the sea-breeze, and stunted by the barrenness and drought of the ground in which they
                        strove to grow. At equidistance, along the coast, rose high square towers, for the double
                        purpose of protecting the coast from smugglers, and enforcing the quarantine regulations.
                        This view was completed by a range of the far-off <pb xml:id="II.286"/> Italian Alps, that
                        from their many folded and volcanic character, as well as from their marble summits, gave
                        them the appearance of glittering snow; to finish the picture, and as a foreground, was
                        placed a remarkable group. </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch32-8">
                        <persName key="LdByron">Lord Byron</persName> with some soldiers of the coast guard, stood
                        about the burning pyre, and <persName key="LeHunt">Leigh Hunt</persName>, whose feelings
                        and nerves could not carry him through the scene of horror, lying back in the carriage; the
                        four post-horses panting with the heat of the noonday sun, and the fierceness of the fire.
                        The solemness of the whole ceremony was the more felt by the shrieks of a solitary curlew,
                        which perhaps attracted by the corpse, wheeled in narrow circles round the pile, so narrow
                        that it might have been struck with the hand. The bird was so fearless, that it could not
                        have been driven away. I am indebted to <persName key="EdTrela1881">one of the
                            party</persName> present, for the interesting particulars of this scene, but must add
                        to it <persName>Leigh Hunt&#8217;s</persName> account. He says&#8212;&#8220;<q>The weather
                            was beautifully fine. The Mediterranean, now soft and liquid, kissed <pb

                            sky entirely contrasted with one another, marble mountains touched the air with
                            coolness, and the flame of the fire bore towards Heaven its vigorous amplitude, waving
                            and quivering with the brightness of inconceivable beauty. It seemed as if it contained
                            the glassy essence of volatility. One might have expected a sun-bright countenance to
                            look out of it, coming once more before it departed, to thank the friends who had done
                            their duty.</q>&#8221; </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch32-9"> I have understood that <persName key="LeHunt">Leigh Hunt</persName> was
                        much offended at the account above given respecting the carriage, but why I am at a loss to
                        guess. To what purpose should he have stood for some hours by the side of the scorching
                        furnace, when there were so many others of stronger nerves, and of better health, present?
                        This extreme sensitiveness on his part is much out of place, for neither my informant nor
                        myself had the slightest intention of throwing on him a taunt, or taxing him with the
                        slightest dereliction of duty. His regard for <persName key="PeShell1822"
                            >Shelley</persName> is not to be ques-<pb xml:id="II.288"/>tioned. The very excess of

                    <p xml:id="ch32-13"> Much objection has been started to these accessories to the funeral pyre,
                        which have been condemned as bearing the character of a heathen rite; but without them it
                        would not only have been dangerous to have assisted at the ceremony, but from the state of
                        the body it would have been intolerable. </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch32-14"> In the evening I saw <persName key="LdByron">Lord Byron</persName>. He was
                        in a high state of fever, from the excitement of the day, combined with exposure for some
                        hours to the sun, in swimming and floating. He was, indeed, almost amphibious, and I have
                        often thought that he must have possessed, as is sometimes known, a peculiar and natural
                        buoyancy,* for he could remain for hours in the water, as he had done that day. The next
                        morning, save and except some blisters, which he said were not confined to his face, he was
                        pretty well recovered. </p>

                        have anticipated it, and must have kept a very bad look out, as proved afterwards by
                            <persName key="DaRober1858">Roberts&#8217;s</persName> discovering her, sunk in ten

                        himself of her, and decked her, and sailed in her, but found her unseaworthy, and that her

                        Ionian Islands, on which she was wrecked. But hoping to be excused this anacronism, I will
                        go on to say, that <persName>Williams</persName> was an expert swimmer, and had, as the
                        boat was filling, found time partially to undress himself, or might have done so in the
                        water, nor can there be a doubt that he made every effort to save his life&#8212;perhaps
                        that of his friend, whilst <persName>Shelley</persName>, who could never learn to swim, had
                        been reading to the last moment, quite unconscious or heedless of danger, and lost in
                        abstraction like a second <persName key="Archi212">Archimedes</persName>; for when found,
                        he had his right hand and arm locked in his waistcoat, where he had in haste thrust a

                        wonderfully admired, and after the death of his brother poet, carried continually about
                        with him the book. <persName key="JaJohns1884">Mrs. Williams</persName> painted to me the

                            hopes that took firmer root even as they were more baseless, were changed to the
                            certainty of the death that eclipsed all happiness for the survivors for
                        evermore.</q>&#8221; In the meanwhile, their absence was attributed first to the rough
                        weather, and they consoled themselves with the reflection, that they might have deferred
                        their departure from this circumstance. Then came a letter of enquiry from <persName

                        arrived to console them with the thought that <persName key="PeShell1822"

                        refuge in one of the islands, Gorgona, or perhaps Sardinia, and their eyes were continually

                            >Shelley</persName> had been subject during this Villagiatura, at the Casa Magni, to
                        strange hallucinations, and from the description of the place, which I had afterwards an
                        opportunity of verifying, it is scarcely to be wondered that his imagination, as happened
                        in Carnarvonshire, naturally given to the marvellous, should have been strangely excited,
                        and grown familiar with the Unreal. The extreme isolation of St. Arenzo&#8212;its almost
                        magical and supernatural beauty&#8212;the continual beating of the sea-waves against the
                        walls of that solitary villa&#8212;the sort of reading in which he indulged there, and a
                        mind ever on the rack with profound metaphysical speculations, dreamy and vague, engendered
                        in him a nervousness, that produced extraordinary waking dreams. <persName
                            key="EdWilli1822">Williams</persName>
                        <pb xml:id="II.299"/> records in his interesting journal, the following

                            the white surf, that broke upon the beach under our feet. Observing him sensibly
                            affected, I demanded of him if he were in pain, but he only answered, by
                                saying,&#8212;&#8220;<hi rend="italic">There</hi> it is again&#8212;<hi
                                rend="italic">There!</hi>&#8221; He recovered after some time, and declared that he
                            saw, as plainly as he saw me, a naked child (<hi rend="italic">the child of a friend
                                who had lately died,</hi>&#8212;meaning his <persName key="AlByron1822">own
                                child</persName>) rise from the sea, and clap its hands as in joy, smiling at him.
                            This was a trance that it required some reasoning and philosophy entirely to awaken him
                            from; so forcibly had the vision operated on his mind.</q>&#8221; But this was not the
                        only illusion to which he had been a prey at St. Arenzo. <persName key="LdByron"
                            >Byron</persName>, the most superstitious of human beings, related the following story,
                        which I afterwards heard confirmed by <persName key="JaJohns1884">Mrs. Williams</persName>.

                        <persName>Shelley</persName>, soon after he arrived at the Casa Magni, one night alarmed
                        all the house with loud and piercing cries. The <persName>Williams&#8217;s</persName>
                        rushed out of their rooms, and <persName key="MaShell1851">Mrs. Shelley</persName>, who had
                        miscarried a few days before, got at the same time as far as the door, and fainted. They
                        found <persName>Shelley</persName> in the saloon, with his eyes wide open, and gazing on
                        vacancy, with a horror as though he saw some spectre. He was in a deep trance, a sort of
                        somnambulism. On waking him, he related to them that he had had a vision. He thought that a
                        figure wrapped in a mantle, came to his bedside, and beckoned him. He got up, and followed,
                        and when in the drawing-room, the phantom lifted up the hood of his cloak, and said,
                                &#8220;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Siete sodisfatto</hi></foreign>&#8221; and
                        vanished. </p>

                        without success, in several of the public libraries of Spain. The story is, that a sort of
                            <persName type="fiction">Cypriano</persName>, or <persName type="fiction"
                            >Faust</persName>, is through life thwarted <pb xml:id="II.301"/> in his plans for the
                        acquisition of wealth or honour or happiness, by a mysterious stranger, who stands in his
                        way like some evil spirit. The hero is at length in love&#8212;we know it is the
                        master-passion in Spaniards. The day is fixed for his nuptials, when the unknown contrives
                        to sow dissension between him and his bride elect, and to break off the match. Infuriate
                        with his wrongs, he breathes nothing but revenge; but for a time all attempts to hunt out
                        his mantled foe prove abortive; at length he presents himself of his own accord. When about
                        to fight, the <foreign><hi rend="italic">embocado</hi></foreign> unmasks, and discovers the

                    <p xml:id="ch33-9"> I performed this journey in a <foreign><hi rend="italic"
                            >caratella</hi></foreign>, with relays of one horse, a mode of conveyance, <pb
                            xml:id="II.305"/> which <persName key="HeMatth1828">Mathews</persName>, the invalid,
                        had reason for recommending, for it enabled me to make much more progress than I could have
                        done by regularly posting with two. I shall not enter into my feelings during this mournful
                        pilgrimage to the sites of my friends&#8217; funeral pyres, at some distance apart, easily
                        discoverable by their ashes. I had another duty to perform, to visit the country house
                        where they had passed their <foreign><hi rend="italic">villegiatura</hi></foreign>. </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch33-10"> From Sarzana to Lerici there is only a cross (and that a narrow) carriage
                        road. After a somewhat difficult ascent of three miles, the <foreign><hi rend="italic"
                                >caleche</hi></foreign> set me down at a bye footpath, which conducts to St.
                        Arenzo. The sky was perfectly cloudless, and not a breath of air relieved the intense heat
                        of an Italian August sun. The day had been unusually oppressive, and there was a mistiness
                        in the atmosphere, or rather a glow which softened down the distances into those mellow
                        tints, in which <persName key="ClLorra1682">Claude</persName> delighted to bathe his
                        landscapes. I was little in a mood to enjoy <pb xml:id="II.306"/> the beauties which
                        increased every moment during this walk. I followed mechanically a pathway overhung with
                        trellised vines, and bordered with olive trees, contrasted here and there with the massy
                        broad dark foliage of the fig-tree. For a mile or two, I continued to ascend, till on a
                        sudden a picture burst on my view, that no pen could describe. Before me was the broad
                        expanse of the Mediterranean, studded with islands, and a few fishing boats with their
                        lattine sails, the sun&#8217;s broad disc just dipping in the waves. </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch33-11"> Thick groves of fruit trees, interspersed with cottages and villas, sloped
                        down to the shores of the gulf of Spezia; and safely land-locked, a little to the left
                        Lerici, with its white flat-roofed houses almost in the sea, stood in the centre, and
                        followed the curve of this bay; the two promontories projecting from which, were surmounted
                        with castles, for the protection of the coast, and the enforcement of the quarantine laws.
                        The descent, now become rapid and broken, and deeply worn into the rock, only offered
                        occasional <pb xml:id="II.307"/> glimpses of the sea, the two islets in front, and the
                        varied cost of Porto Venere to the right. I now came in sight of St. Arenzo, a village, or
                        rather a miserable collection of windowless black huts, piled one above the other, inclosed
                        within and imbedded, like swallows&#8217; nests, in the rocks that overhang and encircle
                        it. The place is inhabited solely by fishermen and their families, on the female part of
                        whom devolves (as is common in Italy) the principal labours. However ungraceful in itself,
                        the peasantry of most parts of Italy have some peculiarity of costume, but the women of St.
                        Arenzo are in a savage state of nature, perfect Ichthyophagæ; their long, coal-black hair
                        trails in greasy strings, unwashed and uncombed over their faces; and some of these
                        fiendish looking creatures had not even fastened it in a knot behind the head, but suffered
                        it to hang half way down their backs. They had neither shoes nor stockings, and the rags
                        which scarcely hid their deformity, were strongly impregnated with the effluvia of the fish
                        they were <pb xml:id="II.308"/> carrying on their bare heads to the neighbouring markets.
                        Their children were just such meagre yellow imps, as from such mothers and filth and
                        poverty of food, might be supposed. The men I did not see; they were most probably
                        following the occupation of fishing. </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch33-12"> Between this village and Lerici, but nearer the former, was pointed out to
                        me the solitary villa, or <hi rend="italic">palazzo</hi> as it is called, which was about
                        to waken in me so many bitter recollections. It is built immediately upon the beach, and
                        consists of one story; the ground floor, when the Libeccio set strongly in, must have been
                        washed by the waves. </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch33-13"> A deaf, unfeeling old wretch, a woman who had the care of the house, and
                        had either witnessed or heard of all the desolation of which it had been the scene, with a
                        savage unconcern, and much garrulity, gave a dry narrative of the story, as she led me
                        through the apartment. </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch33-14"> Below was a large unpaved sort of entrance-hall, without doors or windows,
                        where lay the <pb xml:id="II.309"/> small flat-bottomed boat, or skiff, much shattered, of
                        which I have already spoken. It was the same my poor friends had on the Serchio. Against
                        the wall, and scattered about the floor, were oars and fragments of spars,&#8212;they told
                        too well the tale of woe. </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch33-15"> A dark and somewhat perpendicular staircase now led us to the only floor
                        that remained. It reminded me somewhat in its arrangement, of an Indian bungolow; the walls
                        whitewashed. The rooms, now without furniture, consisted of a saloon and four chambers at
                        the four corners; this, with the exception of a terrace in front, was the whole apartment.
                        The verandah, which ran the entire length of the villa, was of considerable width, and the
                        view from it of a magical and supernatural beauty. </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch33-16"> There was now a calm desolation in the unrippled marble of the sea, that
                        reminded me in its contrast, of the days and nights of tempest and horror which <persName
                            key="MaShell1851">Mrs. Shelley</persName> and <persName key="JaJohns1884">Mrs.

                        for the fate of their beloved husbands&#8212;fancying that every sail would bring them to
                        their homes, and now that in the roaring of every wave they could distinguish their
                        drowning cries, I could picture to myself the ghastly smile with which <persName
                            key="EdTrela1881">Trelawney</persName> related the finding of the corpses,&#8212;the
                        torpor and unconsciousness of <persName>Mrs. Williams</persName>,&#8212;the sublime
                        firmness of <persName>Mrs. Shelley</persName>, contrasted with her frame worn out with
                        sickness,&#8212;their children, too young to be sensible of their loss, clasped in their
                        despairing and widowed mothers&#8217; arms. All this rushed upon my imagination, and
                        insensible to the heat, or fatigue of the ascent, I found myself, scarcely knowing how,
                        where my caleche was waiting for me; and it was midnight, and after a twenty-two
                        hours&#8217; journey, more harassing in mind and body than I had ever experienced, when I
                        reached the inn at Spezia. </p>

                            happiness, pure and good.</q>&#8221; But on their arrival at Rome, considerable
                        scruples arose in the mind of the clergyman applied to to officiate, concerning the burying
                        in consecrated ground, ashes. A <persName key="RiBurge1881">friend of mine</persName>,
                        himself no mean poet, and who wrote an elegy on <persName>Shelley</persName> worthy of a
                        place here, and whose position in life gave him some weight, exerted himself, and
                        successfully, in smoothing the difficulty; and a day was fixed for the interment. The
                        funeral was attended by most <pb xml:id="II.312"/> of the English still lingering in the
                        metropolis of the world. The crowd of strangers that people it from all countries, had
                        withdrawn, and left only behind a few stragglers, and lovers of art, and mourners over the
                        once great queen of the universe, loth to quit it, as mourners the grave of one beloved. </p>

                    <p xml:id="ch34-2"> This friend writing to me says,&#8212;&#8220;<q>Behold the melancholy
                            cortege taking up its line, and following the remains of him, who should have had a
                            distinguished place in the great national cemetery of the poets of his country, to the
                            Protestant burial-ground, which had been unwillingly accorded, through the intercession
                            of <persName key="ErConsa1824">Cardinal Gonsalvi</persName>, prime minister of
                                <persName key="Pius7">Pope Pius VI.</persName>, to us heretics. That last refuge
                            for the stranger-dead, lies, as you know, at the further extremity of the Eternal City,
                            and to get to it, we had to traverse Rome in all its length. I was never so impressed
                            by any funeral; we viewed on all sides the tottering porticoes, the isolated columns,
                            which told me of the ravages of the <pb xml:id="II.313"/> Goths and Vandals, those
                            savages, after gorging themselves in the blood of the vanquished, those barbarians, who
                            insatiate of slaughter, when they had nothing else to destroy, vented their jealous
                            rage on the creations of genius, which like the spectres of their victims, seemed to
                            stand in mockery and defiance. They could shatter the mighty giantess, tear her limb
                            from limb; but the Torso, like that of the Vatican, the admiration of <persName
                                key="MiBuona1564">Michael Angelo</persName> in his blindness, yet remained to
                            suggest that she had been. They could melt the Roman cement, enwrap her domes in
                            flames, throw down her statues from their heights that frowned upon them, and when
                            tired of the labour of destruction, encumber the bed of the Tiber with her mutilated
                            remains.</q>

                            greatness. Neither my companion nor myself spoke, or expressed our admiration or
                            sympathy, that were too strong for <pb xml:id="II.314"/> words. Self-absorbed, I
                            allowed my ideas to wander, lost in the past. I neither gave the ruins names,
                            &#8216;nor suggested doubts as to the period of their erection; whether they were of
                            the time of <persName key="JuCaesa">Julius Cæsar</persName>, or the Antonines.
                            Nothing,</q>&#8221; he adds, &#8220;<q>is so delightful as the mystery, the vagueness
                            that hangs about most of what is left of ancient Rome, for it is this very scepticism
                            and uncertainty that allow the imagination to revel in a world of dreams and visions,
                            each more enchanting than the last. This idea brought with it many a passage in
                                <persName key="PeShell1822">Shelley&#8217;s</persName> works, which is made
                            intelligible to our minds by a sort of divination,&#8212;not from the construction of
                            the words themselves, but from the dim shadowing out of some profound and metaphysical
                            idea, that from the imperfection of language, defies analysis; and his <name

                        a pride. Bristol has with a late repentance raised a statue to <persName key="ThChatt1770"

                            excess of light. Piercing through this, we discover that the characteristics of his
                            poetic writings are an excessive sympathy with the whole universe, material and
                            intellectual&#8212;an <pb xml:id="II.326"/> ardent desire to benefit his species, and
                            an impatience of the tyrannies and superstitions that hold them bound. In all his works
                            there is a wonderfully sustained sensibility, and a language lofty and fit for it. His
                            ear was of the finest, and his command of language unrivalled. His mastery of words was
                            so complete, and his majestic and happy combinations so frequent, that the richness is
                            often obscured by the profusion.</q>&#8221; Again: &#8220;<q>he has the art of using
                            the stateliest words, and the most learned idioms, without incurring the charge of
                            pedantry, so that passages of more splendid and sonorous writing, are not to be
                            selected from any writer since the time of <persName key="JoMilto1674"
                                >Milton</persName>; and yet when he descends from his ideal world, and comes home
                            to us in our humble bowers and our yearnings after love and affection, he attunes the
                            most natural feelings to a style so proportionate, and withal to a modulation so truly
                            musical, that there is nothing to surpass it in the lyrics of <persName

                            lofty feeling, not of waggoners and idiot children. Like <persName key="JoMilto1674"
                                >Milton</persName>, he does not love to contemplate clowns and vices, but the
                            loftiest forms of excellence which his fancy can paint. His morality has also reference
                            to the virtues which he admires, and not to the vices of which he is either
                            unconscious, or ashamed. He looks upwards with passionate veneration, and seldom

                            trembled as the flame of light trembles. He was like his own lark, and mounts higher
                            and higher as he sings. He drew forth poetry from all things which lay in his way, that
                            others pass by unheeded and unobserved. His transparent imagination was lit up by
                            thought. Contemplation, reflection lent him the words that he called into his service.
                            All that he wrote sprung from high and noble ideas. Above all others, he knew how to
                            unlock and develope the nature and perfections of his poetry. He <pb xml:id="II.329"/>

                            going over the ice of the Alps. His forms of life raised themselves so high, that we
                            could not follow him: but as a balloon by degrees is lost to the eye, though we cannot
                            see it, we know that it is there.</q>&#8221; It has been objected by a <persName

                        existing prejudices and deep-rooted passions. To cut his own path, he must displace the
                        rubbish that encumbers it. He is therefore in opposition to his fellow men, and attacks
                        their interests. Blinded by prejudice, by passion, and by interest, they cannot see the
                        excellence of him they oppose, and hence it is, as Heine has admirably

                        poem which I never met with more than one German who pretended to explain.
                            <persName>Shelley</persName> did not condescend to enlighten his readers. Having
                        committed a grave error in penning his Notes to <name type="title" key="PeShell1822.Mab"
                            >Queen Mab</name>, he never ventured on a second experiment. His great master,

                        heights and lowest depths, often but partially <pb xml:id="II.332"/> seized it, being
                        defeated by its very vastness; ambitious to reveal it to mankind, he hesitated not to
                        exhibit it in the form, and with the completeness he best could. It was necessary
                        therefore, that what he but half knew himself, should be imperfect and darkly stated, and
                        dimly comprehended by others. For this reason, his writings are obscure. They will always
                        be obscure, in spite of the labours of the commentators; for a commentary can make them
                        plain only by substituting the reveries of the critic, for the inconsequent reasoning of
                        the original. But <persName>Plato</persName> did not aim at darkness, any more than
                            <persName>Shelley</persName>. If any one understood <persName>Plato</persName>, it was
                            <persName>Shelley</persName>, and that which appears a wordy mist glowing in rainbow
                        clouds, was to his own mind as clear and palpable as the sublimity of such contemplations
                        was capable of being made. But how few can appreciate or comprehend him,&#8212;how
                        inadequate and imperfect is all language, to express the subtilty and volatility of such
                        conceptions of the Deity! To the generality of <pb xml:id="II.333"/> readers, his
                        Metaphysics are so overlaid and buried beneath a poetic phraseology, that the mind, while
                        it is undoubtedly excited, is left in a pleasing and half bewildered state, with visions of
                        beautiful divine truth floating before it, which it is a vain attempt to arrest and convert
                        to reality. </p>

                        him substitute for the popular representation of a God in the form of man, a pervading

                        this reason he has been called an Atheist. It is true that in a moment of thoughtless and
                        foolish levity, he in the Album of the Montanvert, wrote under his name a Greek line, which
                        I have forgotten, ending with Αθεοστς, and which <persName key="RoSouth1843"

                        evidence weighs nothing in comparison with the serious and recorded opinions laid down in
                        his works, and to which momentary foolish freak <pb xml:id="II.336"/> the purity of his
                        life gave the lie. And speaking of what has been called Atheism, <persName

                            such men is but a vivid sense of the universe about them, trying to distinguish the
                            mystery of its operations from the ordinary, and as they think pernicious
                            Anthropomorphism, in which our egotism envelopes it;</q>&#8221; and speaking of
                            <persName>Cenci</persName>, he adds, &#8220;<q>that the Atheism of such men is the only
                            real Atheism; that is to say, it is the only real disbelief in any great and good
                            thing, physical and <pb xml:id="II.337"/> moral. For the same reason, there is more
                            Atheism to all intents and purposes of virtuous and useful belief, in some bad
                            religions, however devout, than in some supposed absence of religion; for the good they
                            purpose to themselves does not rise above the level of the world they live in, except
                            in power like a Roman emperor; so that there is nothing to them really outside the
                            world at last. One act of kindness,</q>&#8221; he adds, &#8220;<q>one impulse of
                            universal benevolence as recommended by the true spirit of <persName>Jesus</persName>,
                            is more grand and godlike than all the degrading ideas of the Supreme Being, which fear
                            and slavery have tried to build up to heaven. It is a greater going out of ourselves, a

                            love and affection, the pursuit of fame, and the intolerance of contemporary criticism,
                            in conjunction with real and unaffected modesty; and in fine, that contrast of virtue
                            and weakness, which is the inheritance of flesh, so requisite seemingly to level the
                            more sublime capacity with its fellow-creatures, and to inculcate the religious bond of
                            union which Christian charity ought to inspire.</q>&#8221; </p>

                        when he died, and might have been taken for nineteen, for there was in him a spirit that
                        seemed to defy time and suffering and misfortune. But if life is to be measured by events
                        and activity, he had arrived at a very advanced age. He often said &#8220;<q>that he had

                        years; this little world, of which he himself and his fairy dreams are the sole
                        inhabitants, circles round a sun of his own, brilliant beyond ordinary conceptions, and in
                        an atmosphere to which that of our brightest day here, is but a dim and heavy mist. As he
