    "# Chapter 3 – Fiction: Growing Down in the Novels of Maria Edgeworth and Amelia Opie\n",
    "\n",
    "According to most scholars, the *Bildungsroman* is the central genre of Romantic fiction. The *Bildungsroman*, at least in its ‘classical’ or Romantic form, is the novel of successful self-formation. The protagonist of the Bildungsroman goes out in the world, develops their personality, and finally settles down. Scholars have constructed a canon around a core of optimistic novels—*Wilhelm Meister’s Apprenticeship* (1795-96), *Pride and Prejudice* (1813), *Waverley* (1814)—whose protagonists successfully go out into the world and find a place within it. In such *Bildungsromane*, the protagonist is both free and constrained. They pursue their inclinations while fulfilling their duties. They express their individuality while conforming to the social order. They achieve a ‘balance of harmony with freedom’, as Karl Morgenstern put it in a classic essay from 1820.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this Chapter, I consider two novels that contradict the concept of the *Bildungsroman*. In Amelia Opie’s *Adeline Mowbray* (1804) and Maria Edgeworth’s *Vivian* (1812), there is no balance between individuality and the social order, between freedom and harmony, between autonomy and authority. To show that these novels were not mere outliers in the period, I analyse them as part of a corpus of 40 novels from the period, including a mixture of classic *Bildungsromane* such as *Camilla* (1796), *Marriage* (1818) and *The Old Manor House* (1793), American network novels such as *Arthur Mervyn* (1799), *The Coquette* (1797) and *Hobomok* (1824), as well as a number of Gothic, Jacobin, Anti-Jacobin, Historical and National Novels. The [files](data/novel-corpus/) and [metadata](data/novel-corpus/manifest.json) can be found in this repository.\n",
